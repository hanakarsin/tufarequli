It is average and not particularly eye-catching. The back of the device is made of plastic, and it houses the rear camera, flash LED and fingerprint sensor. The slight two-tone finish is noticeable. Compared to other smartphones in the same range, the overall design is outdated. It comes in New Aurora Black and Blue colours.</p><p class=align-left>The sides of the device are also made of plastic. Around the screen, there is a thick bezel that makes the smartphone to appear larger and bulkier. The dimensions of this device are 148.6 x 75 x 8.6 millimetres (5.85 x 2.95 x 0.34 inches). It is possible to use the phone with one hand. With its weight of 168.1 grammes (5.93 oz), it is a bit tiring to hold after an extended period of holding it. The power and volume buttons are on the left side, and some people find this odd.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ce1ce796769e3e8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>iPhone XR review: A reliable smartphone with amazing features</span></p></a><h3>Display</h3><p class=align-left>The mobile phone comes with a screen size of 5.3 inches. It has a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels which is unimpressive in the present day and age. Most people prefer high definition screens. It also comes with an IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen. This is not the best type of screen in the market, but it is functional.</p><h3>Processor, storage, and performance</h3><p class=align-left>This device comes with a basic Qualcomm MSM8917 Snapdragon 425 (28 nm) chipset that is paired with a Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU. For a basic device, not much is expected. This processor is functional and reliable under normal use. However, it cannot run many applications simultaneously, and neither can it run bulky applications without becoming sluggish.</p><p class=align-left>It also comes with 2 GB of RAM. For the average phone user who does not need many applications and features, this is relatively okay. Its internal memory is 32 GB. This storage space can be expanded using a micro SD card of up to 2 TB. The overall performance of this device is average. It is suitable for people who do not use their devices for bulky applications or those who do not use their smartphones for gaming.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/87ab17185b70a105.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A detailed look into the Infinix Hot 8 Lite</span></p></a><h3>LG K30 battery size</h3><p class=align-left>This smartphone comes with a Li-Ion 2880 mAh battery, which is non-removable. This size is relatively okay. Under constant use, it gives up to 6 hours <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">of running time</a>. It lasts longer when it is idle. The device uses a type-C 1.0 reversible connector for charging. It also features a 10W charging system.</p><h3>Speaker and call quality</h3><p class=align-left>The quality of audio from the speaker and during calls is clear. It comes with a 3.5 mm audio jack that allows the user to easily connect their wired earphones to listen to music or watch a video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ec53de089eeb4ee.jpg><h2>Software</h2><p class=align-left>What software features can we expect from this device?</p><h3>OS & features</h3><p class=align-left>LG K30 Android version is 7.1 (Nougat). This version is outdated. One of the impressive elements in this device is that it has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Many other smartphones in its range lack this feature. With it, the user can secure their mobile phone and unlock it using one touch. Other sensors in this smartphone are accelerometer, proximity and compass.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/546916fc67ebc1a6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why Nokia 3 is an outstanding budget phone</span></p></a><h3>LG K30 camera specs</h3><p class=align-left>The primary camera in this device is 13 megapixels. For an entry-level device, it is also not very impressive. It takes pictures that are relatively okay in good lighting. In dim or low lit areas, it is unable to capture good shots. The user can also record videos using this camera. At the front, there is a 5-megapixel selfie camera. It takes soft pictures regardless of the lighting.</p><h2>Reviews</h2><p class=align-left>These are some of the comments, thoughts and feelings about the device from Twitter;</p><h2>LG K30 accessories</h2><p class=align-left>What do you get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inside the box</a> when you purchase this device?</p><ul><li>The phone itself</li><li>A USB 2.0 cable</li><li>A charger</li><li>A user manual</li></ul><h2>Verdict</h2><p class=align-left>This device is functional for the average phone user who is not on their phone constantly. While it offers value for money, it is not a good choice for people who play games, store many files and applications or watch movies on their phones.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3be6702c0ec3eae1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover top facts about the Samsung Galaxy A10e</span></p></a><p class=align-left>LG K30 is an entry-level device that is not expensive and is very functional. There is nothing special about it, except that it has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The smartphone is suitable for people who do not use their phone often, and those who do not store and run large files and applications.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnODj25ramWcnHqsf49mp6uhk5p6tLzEnKpmqpWrtqbDjJ2crZmZocBvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
