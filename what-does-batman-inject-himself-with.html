Toward the end of the film, Batman seemingly injects himself with a mysterious green substance to continue fighting in the climactic final battle. So, what was the serum? What did Batman inject himself with? Let's find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.

In there, Riddler's army wreaks havoc until Batman stealthily arrives and puts a stop to the terrorism.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fight becomes too much for him, and Batman is nearly defeated. As he fades out of consciousness, <a href=#>Catwoman (Zoë Kravitz)</a> finds herself in grave danger. In a flash, Batman pulls out a syringe and injects himself with a green serum that instantly revives him. As a result, Batman beats the Riddler follower to a pulp until those nearby stop him from killing the guy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>did I just watch batman inject himself with adrenaline and then almost beat some rando to death after tanking a shotgun blast to the chest?</p>— FGC2|Flynn Jeux (@FlynnJeux) <a href=#>March 5, 2022</a></figure><p>Although there's a debate surrounding the substance Batman injects himself with, the dose likely consists of pure adrenaline. Essentially, the serum gives Batman a rush of energy, strength, and extreme rage that allows him to overpower Riddler's minion and almost lose control. Had Lieutenant Jim Gordon (<a href=#>Jeffrey Wright</a>) not intervened, Batman might've beaten the man to death.</p><p>Some believe Batman injects himself with Venom, a drug that Bane uses to achieve his super-human abilities. But, it seems highly unlikely Batman injects himself with Venom because the physical strength transformation would've been more dramatic. Plus, it's a serum that's typically associated with villains, meaning Batman wouldn't be caught dead with it.</p><p>The Batman is now streaming on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZeutbnAp2SippqasLV5x6KkrJ2cm3q4tdOh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
