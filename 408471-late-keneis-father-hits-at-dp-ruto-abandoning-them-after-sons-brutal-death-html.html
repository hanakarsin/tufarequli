Still, Chesang says Ruto has kept his distance and remained mum on the matter.</p>“Since that time, no action has been taken and we haven’t communicated in any way. We were expecting to see him (the DP) because he had stated that he could have been the target and not Kenei. What action has he taken?” the emotional Chesang posed.“We just see him go about his business. We are truly in pain. Our son worked in that office for seven and a half years. Why has the office not given him any respect?” he wondered.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3cf95k0feee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benjamin Ayimba: Rugby Legend Critically ill after Cerebral Malaria Diagnosis</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chesang noted that he was still bothered by Ruto's remarks during Kenei’s burial that he knew him (the father) but did not know Kenei was his son.</p>“What if he’d known, would my son still be alive? And now that he knows, what action has he taken?” he charged, stating his intention to revive the high-profile murder case.<p class=align-left>In his speech, while mourning Kenei, Ruto claimed that his life was on the line at the time of Kenei’s death and that the DCI was being used to undermine his office.</p><p class=align-left>The family fears the remarks could hinder their efforts to find justice for their son.</p>“He (Ruto) appears not comfortable with the DCI or even FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigations) investigating the case. But he has never offered us an alternative to finding justice. Why has he not informed us of any other entity he is using to carry out the investigations? What does he want?” Chesang questioned.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4e351295f2674029.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>74-Year-Old State Minister Sabo Nanono Secretly Weds 18-Year-Old School Dropout</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The father revealed that before the brutal murder, Kenei was uncomfortable working in the DP’s office due to his colleagues' alleged discrimination and had unsuccessfully tried to secure a transfer twice.</p>“My son wanted to move somewhere else because he was a Tugen and most of his colleagues were Nandis,” Chesang explained, listing late payment and restriction from travelling outside the office as some of the challenges his son reportedly faced.<p class=align-left>He believes his son would still be alive today had his bosses transferred him from the DP’s office.</p><p class=align-left>Chesang concurred with DCI boss George Kinoti that Kenei did not commit suicide - as it was made to appear courtesy of a suicide note found beside his body - but that he was put through an excruciating death by his killers.</p>“Those who killed my son, may they never know peace.
