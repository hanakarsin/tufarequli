Among the contemporary country music artists who are leading the charge is <a href=#>Kane Brown.</a></p><p>Born in Georgia and raised in Tennessee, Kane quickly climbed the charts following his musical debut, and as Kane’s fanbase grew, so did his family. Kane Brown and his wife, <a href=#>Katelyn Brown</a>’s, love story began in 2016. Nearly a decade and three kids later, the couple is still locked in.</p><p>We caught up with Kane on the Chicago stop of his "In The Air" tour. In his exclusive interview with Distractify, Kane got candid about marriage, life as a father of three, and how his close-knit family stays connected when he’s on tour.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jason Kempin/Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kane Brown said his wife, Katelyn Brown, is his “best friend.”</h2><p>Name a better duo than Kane and Katelyn Brown; I’ll wait. The country music power couple have been married since 2018 — with six years down and a lifetime to go.</p><p>Not only do Kane and Katelyn make beautiful music together in the booth, but they also have a harmonious relationship at home. In fact, Kane says his wife is his “best friend.”</p><p>“Kate's got such a big heart. She's such a great wife, such a great mom — and always just finds time to want to be with me. And you know, she lets me know that too.” Kane told us.</p><p>“Like, if I'm gone too much — I'm like, ‘Hey, I'm gonna golf.’ And then the next day, I'm like, ‘Hey, I'm playing video games.' And she’s like, ‘Babe, I want to hang out with you. I want to spend time with you,’” he went on. “So, of course, it's my best friend. So I'm gonna make time for that.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Denise Truscello/Getty Images for iHeartRadio</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kane and Katelyn Brown have two kids together, and are expecting their third.</h2><p>Along with their two daughters, Rose and Kingsley, Kane and Katelyn are set to welcome a new addition to the fam. In early 2024, the couple announced that they were expecting a baby boy.</p><p>Kane brought the whole gang on the "In The Air" tour, ensuring he never misses a beat, on stage or at home.</p><p>“Kingsley — she's a singer. I think she'll be my singer out of all of them. It’s good just having them out here. We're not having to miss any moments,” he said with a smile.</p><p>Although Kane enjoys spending as much time with his family as possible, there are times when he has to be away from home for days and even weeks at a time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kane Brown (@kanebrown)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">When Kane Brown is away on tour, he FaceTimes his family “six to seven” times daily.</h2><p>Even when the Brown family isn’t together, they’re still together. According to Kane, he video chats with his wife and kids a half dozen times every day when he's on the road.</p><p>“Six to seven FaceTimes a day — just talking to the babies, seeing what they're doing,” Kane gushed.</p><p>After all, Kane is well aware that quality time with family isn’t a privilege afforded to everyone — including the people who serve our country.</p><p>“[My family] knows that I'm coming home. I might be away for a month or whatever. And that's hard on me. But imagine somebody's fight for our country,” Kane said. “They have kids or a wife or whoever's waiting on them at home.”</p><p>“They don't know if they're coming home. So it's a scary place to be,” he added.</p><p>Kane’s dedication to family extends far beyond his own, so he’s teamed up with Crown Royal — the official Whiskey of the "In The Air" tour — to recognize the sacrifices made by military families.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BFA for Crown Royal</span></figure><p>As part of the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deserves a Crown with Kane Brown</a>” campaign, fans can nominate a veteran to win an all-expense paid trip to Kane’s final "In The Air" tour stop in Arlington, Texas through Aug. 25.
