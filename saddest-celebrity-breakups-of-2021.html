As such, most of the breakups on this list are still pretty shocking to think about — and even more heartbreaking to accept. Did your favorite celebrity couple survive 2021 ... or are they totally over?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello have decided to breakup.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=#>Shawn Mendes</a> and <a href=#>Camila Cabello</a> met for the first time in 2014 and totally hit it off. They began dating in 2019 and continually posted some of the cutest PDA-filled shots on social media throughout the course of their relationship. Sadly, they released a joint statement on Instagram in November 2021 letting their fans know that they’ve <a href=#>decided to part ways</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are done ... again.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After all the chances <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a>'s given <a href=#>Tristan Thompson</a>, they reportedly decided to break up in summer 2021. Unfortunately, they were still together when <a href=#>he impregnated another woman</a> named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maralee Nichols</a>, and the scandal has been a scalding-hot topic in recent days.

They even have a child together named X Æ A-12. They announced their breakup in September 2021, and since then it looks like she's released a heartbreak song dedicated to Elon. The song is called “Player of Games." Yikes!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid are no longer together.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The unfortunate scandal surrounding <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a> and <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>'s breakup was a total shock to fans of the One Direction singer and the model. They recently welcomed their firstborn daughter into the world in 2020, but exciting media coverage about their happy little family has been overshadowed by an alleged incident between Zayn and Gigi's mother, <a href=#>Yolanda Hadid</a>, in October 2021.

The reported reason why? He slid into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Younes Bendjima</a>’s DMs to talk badly about <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> — but his messages ended up getting exposed by Younes. The messages made it seem like Scott was still heavily concerned about Kourtney's current lifestyle and her new relationship with <a href=#>Travis Barker</a>. Not too long after Scott’s DMs with Younes were posted, his relationship with Amelia was over.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are done.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> and <a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a> started dating in 2017, but after being engaged for two years, they decided they no longer wanted to make it work.
