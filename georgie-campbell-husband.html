After Georgie fell into the water at a fence during a cross-country event, she died on the scene, although her horse, Global Quest, walked away uninjured. While Jesse has yet to make a public statement, the Bicton International Horse Trials has shared:</p><p>“It is with deepest regret that we announce that Georgie Campbell (GBR) suffered a fatal accident whilst competing at the Bicton International Horse Trials in Devon, England on Sunday 26 May 2024. Medical professionals attended immediately following her fall at fence 5b, however, unfortunately, she could not be saved.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jesse Campbell (@jesse_campbell89)</a></p></figure><p>“The horse, Global Quest, was assessed by the on-site vets and walked back to the stable and is uninjured. To respect the family’s privacy at this extremely difficult and sad time, no further details will be shared.” At the time, Jesse has seemingly stayed off of social media, with his last post shared on Nov. 1, 2023.</p><p>But Jesse is an equestrian competitor in his own right. His wife’s death will of course be detrimental leading up to his potential 2024 Olympics performance, but it could also cause a crisis of confidence in the sport he’s known and loved his entire life. Like Georgie, Jesse has been training his entire life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Georgie Campbell (@mrsgeorgiecampbell)</a></p></figure><p>In 2009, he was invited to train in Sweden and the UK, where he established his own yard in 2011. Hailing originally from New Zealand, Jesse was a member of their Nations Cup team in 2013 and has won 21 major New Zealand and International Eventing titles. He was part of New Zealand’s team at the Tokyo Olympics and is supposed to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics as well, although that could change following his wife’s death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jesse and Georgie Campbell’s story was an equestrian fairytale.</h2><p>Jesse and Georgie met through their equestrian passion and married on Dec. 12, 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic in the Wiltshire village of Ramsbury. They were supposed to have a 150-guest wedding in November of the same year, but pandemic restrictions forced them to adapt. “In spite of everything, we said we wanted to be married this year,”<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Georgie said at the time</a>. “We’ll plan to have a big party as well as a trip back to New Zealand as soon as we are able.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Georgie & Jesse Campbell (@teamcampbelleventing)</a></p></figure><p>They had just 15 friends and family present at the small ceremony to comply with restrictions, but it was still a beautiful wedding. “The restrictions meant it was much more intimate than it might otherwise have been. The highlight was still seeing Georgie walking the aisle,” Jesse added.</p><p>Together, they founded Campbell Eventing, which is an equestrian group based near Lamberhurst in Kent, despite Jesse’s New Zealand roots. Now, the question is if he’ll still compete in the Olympics and how he’ll fare following his wife’s sudden death.</p><p>Our condolences go out to Jesse and the Campbells’ entire community of friends, family, and fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLKwvsainGabkaK9o7HLpWShraOXrq%2Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
