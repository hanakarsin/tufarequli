She was already coming to national attention as early as 1955, when she was just 11 years old, but the peak of her career came in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as she was becoming a young adult.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>In 2023, decades after her successful career, Brenda has finally recorded her first number one hit, and it naturally came with the song that she has come to be most closely associated with in the decades since it was initially released. As many failed Christmas albums will tell you, it's hard for songs to become a new Christmas staple.</p><p>"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" has had that status for decades, and it's clearly responsible for a good deal of Brenda's continued financial success. Thanks to that song along, Brenda will likely never be poor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BmusOaZKWdlWK7psCMsKarrJg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
