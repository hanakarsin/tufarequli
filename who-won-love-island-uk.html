That would be Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and Davide Sanclimenti.</h2><p>Ekin-Su and Davide entered the villa on Day 3 and Day 1, respectively. They were crowned as the winners of Love Island U.K. after a tumultuous ride featuring cheating scares, a series of swoon-worthy dates, and a few shouting matches featuring catchphrases like "you're a liar, an actress, go the f--k out."</p><p>Ekin-Su reportedly underwent a dramatic filler makeover just in time for the show, perhaps because she wanted to cement her place as the ultimate bombshell on Love Island U.K. Her ability to shake things up in the villa immediately earned her comparisons to Love Island U.K. icon <a href=#>Megan Barton-Hanson</a>.</p><p>Ekin-Su had her head turned a few times. At one point, she expressed an interest in exploring her prospects with Jay Younger. She also voiced her appreciation of Adam Collard's otherworldly physique.</p><p>But she and Davide managed to maneuver their way around various obstacles, including that time Davide locked lips with newcomers Coco Lodge and Mollie Salmon during the famously chaotic period of Casa Amor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu (@ekinsuofficial)</a></p></figure><p>Ekin-Su and Davide declared their status as a couple, and a series of swoon-worthy dates followed, including a trip to a colosseum-style setting. Ekin-Su and Davide were treated to plates of fresh pasta and a private concert by star-status singer and actor Alfie Boe.</p><p>Reflecting on the evolution of their romance, Ekin-Su told Davide that he has helped her come out of her shell.</p><p>"You've brought this completely different side to me that I've hidden for many years," Ekin-Su said. "And I was actually scared to show this side for a long time. But you've proven to me that someone is out there that accepts me for who I am. I've realized that ... as long as you're with me, there's no place I'd rather be."</p><p>They confessed their love for each other the same night.</p><p>Ekin-Su and Davide snatched up the enviable title of the winners of Season 8 of Love Island U.K. at the end of the finale airing on Monday, Aug. 1, 2022, sharing a passionate kiss upon learning about the big news.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Luca Bish and Gemma Owen finished in second place on Season 8 of 'Love Island U.K.'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: ITV</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>Luca Bish, a Brighton-based fishmonger, and Gemma Owen, who struggled to disclose details about her star-status father, Michael Owen, in the first few weeks of Season 8 of Love Island U.K., came second.</p><p>Luca and Gemma dated a few other contestants before coupling up for good on Day 18.

Indiyah and Dami found their way back to each other. What's more, Dami heroically withstood the grilling he received from Indiyah's parents in a recent episode.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tasha Ghouri and Andrew Le Page came fourth.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: ITV</a></figure><p>Tasha Ghouri and Andrew Le Page impressed viewers with their gentleness and ability to resist worldly temptations.
