Some persons from the party recently went to meet Wike to pledge their loyalty to him as their leader, although Wike is not a member of the APC. Politics in Nigeria has taken a new dimension that transcends human comprehension. The system has lost integrity; so distorted and uncoordinated. I don’t know whether to say the trend is part of the end time.</p><p>“I know you would like me to relate my response to Amaechi. That’s just the direction of your question. The truth of the matter is that Amaechi is still a member of APC and in that case, he is the undisputed leader of APC in the South-South region. All the machinations against him will not stand.</p><p>“I must use this opportunity to highlight that Amaechi is a very patriotic Nigerian and his thoughts and vision will remain on the possibility of a better Nigeria. So, let us exercise a little patience as Amaechi will soon address the nation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BqZrChm5p6sL6MmqSanZOdtm6x2Z5kq52mmq6tv4yap5xlnJqupbHRZqCnZaKew6a%2B0maqrZmkmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
