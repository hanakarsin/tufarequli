If you're fascinated with accents, then there's probably a good chance you've visited the International Dialects of English Archive, where there are recordings of folks speaking English with various accents from around the world.

There are a number of TikTokers who have pointed out the fact that the simple, monosyllabic word "no" sounds very different when people from Australia say it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As user @tiffanykrylov says, it's almost a two-syllable word that's a combination of "no" and "nah" and "aauurrr." That last one really isn't a word, but that's the accent for you.</p><p>Have a listen below to see exactly what she's talking about.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After this pronunciation went viral, a number of TikTokers opted to write "naur" as a little joke in comments, which is a little head nod to this meme trend.
