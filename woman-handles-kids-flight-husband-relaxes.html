Source: Instagram/@mariarobertsAnyone who's flown in a plane before knows that children can be annoying to sit with during the journey. However, no one knows that better than the parents who are caring for the kids in the first place. It can be easy to forget, but by and large, parents are fully aware of how difficult it can be to take care of kids on a plane and how frustrating it can be for other people."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In a video posted on Nov. 13, 2023, Maria showed what it was like for her and her husband to fly with their two <a href=#>kids</a>. However, her video showed her doing most of the work <a href=#>while her husband relaxed</a> in another seat. It's caused some divisiveness on the internet, but Maria has since tried to clear the air.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This woman wants to set the record straight on how she and her husband handle their kids on flights.</h2><p>In Maria's short video, she offered an interesting comparison between what she typically goes through on an airplane compared to what her husband goes through. On one particular flight, she was seated with her two young children while her husband was seated beside them in a separate arrangement.</p><p>The difference was practically night and day. Maria spent much of her time setting up her kids with headphones, TV, activities, and whatever they might need to keep themselves well-behaved during their flight.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maria Roberts (@mariaroberts)</a></p></figure><p>As for Lou, he was seated silently and calmly in his own separate seat. Like any of us, he simply had his headphones plugged in as he watched whatever was part of the in-flight entertainment.</p><p>From the outset, it looks like a case of a <a href=#>mother taking on way more responsibility</a> for a family while the father kicks back and relaxes. In other words, it's not a great look at first.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>To that end, plenty of folks in the comments section had a bone to pick with Lou.</p><p>One person wrote, "I cannot believe that in 2023, women still accept this behavior."</p><p>Another person commented, "Let’s promote a new standard and SHAME <a href=#>weaponized incompetence</a> of our spouses. You deserve better!"</p><p>However, Maria has since tried to set the record straight and has come forward explaining how she actually splits responsibilities with her husband.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>, Maria admitted that her kids have an attachment to their mom that may pose a problem on planes.</p><p>"The kid that isn't with me would be crawling over the rows to get to me and that would cause a scene," she told the outlet. "We're just doing what makes our lives easier and this is what works for us."</p><p>She also revealed that if she needed Lou at any point, he wouldn't hesitate to drop what he was doing and help out.</p><p>Maria has also responded to some of the backlash that the video has received.</p><p>"I'm not offended and neither is Lou. Just because he sits in the fourth seat on an airplane doesn't mean he's not an amazing dad."</p><p>While the video itself raises a valid point that dads should have more of an emotional and active involvement in their children's well-being, that doesn't necessarily mean that Lou isn't providing that as far as Maria is concerned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mn5qmlKGytHnKopusZZahtqi002afrquSlruledGeo5qwlag%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
