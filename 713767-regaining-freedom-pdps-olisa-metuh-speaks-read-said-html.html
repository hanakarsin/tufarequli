Hon. Mark Field, member of Parliament and Chairman of International Office of the Conservative Party, and Colin Bloom, director of outreach-BCP in Abuja&nbsp;on Friday.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Olisa Metuh’s Trial: You need to read what this new witness has to say</p><p>He told the visitors that the PDP faced serious challenges soon after it lost in the elections, culminating in the resignation of its National Chairman, a development that created some challenges within the party, but assured that every issue would be resolved by the party leadership by next week.</p><p>In his remark, Rt. Hon. Mark Field advised the party to ensure that it does not trash its brand in the face of challenges. He noted that while it is common for some party members to demand the removal of leaders after electoral defeat, care must be taken not to jeopardize institutional memory in the party.</p><p><i>"Never trash your brand no matter whatever the government of the day is saying about you"</i>, he admonished the PDP.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Again! Court adjourns Metuh’s case till next month</p><p>The interaction was attended by PDP publicity staff, social media operatives of the party and officials of the International Republican Institute (IRI), who facilitated the visit.</p><p>Chief Metuh said the recent variance of voices from its members is as a result of the party’s foundation of liberal democracy, which he described as a mark of strength, adding that the party has adequate internal mechanisms to resolve all issues within its fold.</p><p>Recall that Metuh was only released on bail yesterday, January 28.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHJ%2Flm9uZqqVnK6qusinnmaeopqypbvMZqedqKNivK210ppkpp2kqrVuv8%2BemKSrXaeyorCMrJiinF6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
