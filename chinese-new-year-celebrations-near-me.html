So here's where you can celebrate the Lunar New Year in a city near you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">New York City</h2><p>As a major American city, it should come as no surprise that New York isn't home to just one Chinatown —&nbsp;its five boroughs are home to several. If you're in Manhattan, you'll definitely want to check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Firecracker Ceremony and Cultural Festival</a> in Chinatown. With dance performances, elaborate costumes, and martial arts displays, it's probably the most vibrant celebration the city has to offer.</p><p>If you'd rather sit out the parade, however, New Yorkers can feast on delicious soup dumplings or noodles at one &nbsp;of Chinatown's many delicious restaurants. Brooklyn's Chinatown in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunset Park</a> will also offer a parade, festival and live music — and the crowds will probably be more manageable than the ones in the city. Those who would rather avoid crowds, however, can attend the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Philharmonic</a>, which is celebrating the new year through classical music.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Los Angeles</h2><p>Thousands of Angelenos will flock onto North Broadway in Chinatown for the 121st annual <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Dragon Parade</a> on Feb. 1, and you should join them if you find yourself in LA for the legendary lunar celebration. If you're feeling a late night on Tuesday, hit up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thien Hau Temple</a>'s midnight ceremony, which starts at 10 p.m. — complete with deity offerings, lion dancers and burning incense, it's a seriously authentic ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>If you somehow sleep on the day-of celebrations, hit up the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese New Year Festival and Parade</a> on Feb. 9, where local artisans, incredible food trucks and live music will convene to keep the Year of the Rat celebrations going.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Seattle</h2><p>The growing Asian population in the Northwest means there's plenty to do in Washington around this time of year. The Chinese New Year Parade and festival in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hing Hay Park</a> is one of the most massive celebrations in the country and luckily, they're waiting until the weekend (on Saturday, Feb. 8), so everyone can get in on the fun.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">New Orleans</h2><p>New Orleans is certainly the place to be for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tet Fest</a>, which is going on Friday, Feb. 7 through Sunday, Feb. 9. Tet Fest is the Vietnamese cousin of Chinese New Year, and Mary Queen of Vietnam Church hosts a free celebration that boasts lion dances and acrobatic stunts, in addition to delicious rice cakes, banh mi and pho... definitely come hungry.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">San Francisco</h2><p>The Golden Gate City goes hard for the Lunar New Year, from the Flower Market Fair which occurred this past weekend, to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese New Year Parade</a> on Saturday, Feb. 8. About half a million people join in on the festivities, making San Fran's celebration one of the biggest and most iconic in the Western world. Chow down on Chinese food and experience the gorgeous nighttime parades all month long if you're lucky enough to find yourself in NoCal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Philadelphia</h2><p>Philly goes big for Lunar New Year, thanks in part to the unmissable cuisine from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sang Kee Noodle House</a>. After you eat to your heart's content, further explore the culture at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International House Philadelphi</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a</a> with traditional Chinese music, martial arts, dance and films.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chicago</h2><p>If temperatures aren't too freezing in the Windy City, hit up the Jan. 25 procession of lions, colorful floats, and music in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago's Chinatown</a>. Meanwhile, take advantage of the delicious cuisine — sit down for traditional dim sum, order some crab dumplings to-go, or stop into one of the oldest bakeries in Chinatown, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chi Quon Bakery</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Houston</h2><p>Over the weekend of Feb. 1, Houstonians will be celebrating the Year of the Rat with folk dances and martial arts performances, bubble tea, and delicious dumplings at their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">annual Lunar New Year celebration</a>. With almost 40,000 annual attendees, this event is not one to sleep on.</p><p>Gong xi fa cai, and all the best for the Year of the Rat! At the very least, it's another chance to give your <a href=#>New Year's resolutions</a> from last month another whirl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWqusSsnGamlax6urHAq2ScnZyar7Ot06Kmp6tdo7KivoymnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
