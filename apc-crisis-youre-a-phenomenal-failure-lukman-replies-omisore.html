I saw him yesterday shamelessly talking about a winning team. If we are a winning team, why prevent us from replicating the feat in your base? We did not only lose the governorship seat, but we also lost all the Senate seats, House of Representatives seats, and House of Assembly seats. Osun is the only state we have that case.</p><p>“It is only the National Secretary that is in denial of that reality. The first mark of a progressive is to have the humility to accept your shortcomings.
