Reacting, governor Diri said that the cost of construction in difficult terrain like Bayelsa state was three times or more times the cost elsewhere."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Simply because I said people should thank President Muhammadu Buhari for releasing 13 percent arrears to some Niger Delta governors.</p><p>“I didn’t abuse any of them. I said just thank him because if he did not release these arrears to me and some of our states, it would have been difficult for me to talk about building a renal center, Cardiovascular Centre, basic and clinical sciences, house officers’ quarters, and many of them.</p><p>“I don’t think saying ‘thank you’ is an offence. On television, I heard one of the governors say in his state to do three-kilometer road will do more than 15 flyovers. Rivers is it not a Niger Delta State? Don’t we have riverine areas in Rivers?</p><p>“The Amayanabo of Opobo said since he was born he had never driven on the road to Opobo. The day he drove to Opobo he said ‘God is it possible that in my own time I am not going through the river again, I can now drive to Opobo?</p><p>“That is a major riverine area. By the grace of God this December, we are going to inaugurate the first phase of the Trans-Kalabari road. It is a major riverine area. I don’t know why some people are sick about my flyovers. Don’t be sick again, I won’t do it again.</p><p>“Instead of you appreciating and asking someone how are you doing this? I have turned the state capital around using a major construction company. If you know you have the capacity go and hire that company and see whether you can pay salaries.</p><p>“People know the contractors I use in this state. Some of them nobody know their contractors. Who are they? Now you have touched me, anything you see you take.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49qZqJllJ6xr8CMmpmuq5VixrDBjKemsGWnnrimedOamqSklah6pbXRomSorpWneqS7zKacp6yjYryvecOeqaKukam2sLqMn6ynnF2lrrq5xKeraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
