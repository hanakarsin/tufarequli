In 1994 at the New Faces Show, when the pair first met, they were both seeing other people. Tim McGraw was dating Nashville real estate agent Kristine Donahue, and Faith had just finalized her divorce from music producer Daniel Hill.</p><p>Two years later, Faith joined Tim on his Spontaneous Combustion tour, and they began a relationship. In October 2015, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, Tim revealed that he proposed to Faith on tour. He recalled, "We were in the dressing room [in] June 26, 1996 ... and we’d been on tour for a while together, and I joked around with her about getting married. And so I looked at her, grabbed her by the hand, and dropped forward [on my knees] onstage."</p><p>Tim continued, "She said, ‘We’re at a country music festival in a trailer house, and you’re asking me to marry you?’ And I said, ‘Yeah.’ So I went onstage … When I came back offstage, [I saw] a Sharpie with lipstick kisses all over it, saying, ‘Yes! I’m gonna be your wife.’"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The couple's whirlwind marriage continued in a surprise ceremony.</h2><p>The pair were married shortly after the proposal on Oct. 6, 1996, in Tim's Louisiana hometown of Rayville. The couple reportedly told friends and family they were invited to a softball game and a concert. When their loved ones showed up, it was a surprise wedding ceremony! Between their performances, music recording sessions, and tours, they welcomed two children: Grace in 1997 and Maggie in 1998.</p><p>In 2000, the pair embarked on their Soul2Soul tour, which is unmatched as the highest-grossing country tour of all time.
