Today, we are discussing the BBI report. If there is any problem with the Jubilee government, it is upon them to sort it out. We are not party to it,"</i> the ODM legislator said, alluding to two Jubilee factions.<p class=align-left>The political temperatures flared immediately Kipchumba pointed out the programme organisers had intentionally planned to leave out those initially opposed to the initiative.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/13bb198017f7d41a.jpeg><i>"We must have an honest discussion here. Even the way Junet is running the program is not good, we must make it an honest discussion. It will be a lie to leave this stage without saying this programme has been skewed to leave out other people. We have come here to seek national unity,"</i> the agitated senator said.<p class=align-left>The visibly angry legislator ran into trouble with the attendees who jeered and booed him while asking him to leave the podium as the cameras focused on him.</p><p class=align-left>An adamant Murkomen continued to speak his mind prompting the BBI task force chairperson and Senator Yusuf Haji to jump to his defence.</p><p class=align-left>It took Haji's intervention to restore order and the Jubilee politician resumed his speech but with a more restrained tone.</p><p class=align-left>Other speakers at the function were Deputy President William Ruto, National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Governor Hassan Joho, woman representatives Gladys Wanga and Sabina Chege among others.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have an inspirational story you would like us to publish?
