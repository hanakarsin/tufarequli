The French protest was ignited by the killing of a teenager from an immigrant community. Where was this fellow, who is now calling for a violent uprising, when a pregnant Northerner from Adamawa, Harira Jubril, was killed by unknown gunmen in broad daylight, with her four underaged daughters, Fatima, 9; Khadijah, 7; Hadiza, 5; and Zaituna, 2.</p><p>“If human life was so important to him, why did he not ask youths to rise and avenge the deaths of Harira and her children in Anambra?</p><p>“Though I am not happy with the results of the #NigerianElections2023, it would be extremely irresponsible to call for the bringing down of Nigerian cities.
