Two people fall in love, and it just so happens one of the needs a K-1visa to move to the United States and the couple only has 90 days to tie the knot.</p><p>However, TLC just premiered a spinoff to the popular reality series, and this time U.S. residents are giving up the American way of life to move across the globe to be with their significant others. From India to Qatar, these romantics are willing to give up everything to be with their international beaus. And TBH, we are already obsessed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Keep scrolling to meet the couples who are going the The Other Way for love.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Jenny and Sumit (India)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Jenny is a 60-year-old mother of three and grandmother of four who decided to move to India to be with Sumit, whom she met on Facebook. Before meeting Sumit, 30, Jenny was married for 15 years, but was blindsided when her ex-husband left her for someone else.</p><p>"You know, what you do for love, sometimes is unbelievable," Jenny said on the show. "I think that everyone is entitled to happiness... I didn't really think I would find love again, to tell you the truth."</p><p>Initially, Sumit catfished Jenny by pretending to be a hot male model named Michael Jones on Facebook but he came clean once he started developing feelings for the California-based grandmother.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@jan_frmsan</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@sumitjenny</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2.

She met Ronald — who just completed rehab for his gambling addiction —&nbsp;while she was on a trip in the African country with a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>"Me and him just had so much chemistry," she explained. "I went back to South Africa six months later and on that trip he actually proposed to me on that same cliff that he took me [the first night]. I was so happy. I never felt like this in my entire life."</p><p>However, she won't be alone. She is also bringing her 8-year-old son, Daniel, along for the adventure. Fun fact: Tiffany didn't know she was pregnant with Daniel until 15 minutes before his birth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@tiffanyronaldsmith</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@mamawolfxo</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3.

Paul and Karine (Brazil)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>If you think Paul, 35, looks familiar, that is because he has appeared on 90 Day Fiancé with his wife, Karine. The couple have had their share of ups and downs —&nbsp;and after suffering a miscarriage, Paul returned to the U.S. to make some money. However, shortly after, Karine discovered she was pregnant again. &nbsp;</p><p>"I love Karine very much and I love this baby," Paul said. "it's very difficult to be apart from Karine when she's pregnant. I really wish I could be there for her during this process because I'm nervous there's a possibility of us having another miscarriage."&nbsp;</p><p>Paul is also trying to get Karine a spousal visa so his move to Brazil likely won't be permanent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@pauljasonstaehle</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>@staehlekarine</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6.
