She insisted that they were a perfect match.</p><p>The other contestants wanted to nip Chris and Shanley's dramatic romance in the bud early on, so they voted to send them to the Truth Booth first.</p><p>The pair later acknowledged that there were many reasons why they wouldn't be a perfect match on paper. Later on in the season, when Chris found out that his perfect match was actually Paige Brendel, Shanley cried.&nbsp;By the finale, Shanley found out that her match was Adam Kuhn.&nbsp;</p><p>Though they knew that they weren't placed together, Chris and Shanley insisted that their bond went beyond the show.</p><p>On the reunion special, host Ryan Devlin asked about where things stood between Chris and Shanley.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We were solid for a second, and then it became too much," Chris shared about their post-show relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>The two explained that they tried to give their romance a shot outside of the show, but that they struggled to maintain a bond while living in different places.&nbsp;</p><p>"We know why we're not a perfect match. We've understood that, and I want everybody else to know, I'm a very physical [person], and he's a very vocal person.

While nothing happened besides a few text message exchanges, Shanley felt betrayed by the action.&nbsp;</p><p>During the reunion, it seemed like there was still unfinished business between the season's most controversial couple. Did anything continue after the full season aired?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Shanley and Chris still together from 'Are You the One?'</h2><p>Though Chris and Shanley doubted the Are You the One perfect match algorithm, the two are no longer together.
