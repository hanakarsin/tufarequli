I sold two million copies in America off of one song! Even some American artists don’t have a diamond record. If I’m being honest, I don’t listen to any other genre of music anymore.</p><p>I don’t listen to rap, that shit is boring to me. It’s dead now, it’s tired. These guys do the same shit, rap on the same beats and the same flows.”</p><h2>Nigerians React</h2><p>Wizkid’s statement sparked mixed reactions as some netizens berated him over the statement while some music enthusiasts agreed with him.</p><p>emini_kabex wrote: “I kuku no blame am for saying such. When even the godfathers and mentors of the RAP game,would rather invest in an average SINGER,but would ignore an never help an obviously talented rapper due to the fear that he might dethrone them and take over their spots. When the scrambling for a club hit song is more than the passion for the game. When even rappers won’t even work with their fellow rappers all in the name of ego, beef and pride,but would spend their last millions to gum body with singers wey use trending slang or lamba blow… What were you expecting??”</p><p>preacherbeats wrote: “I listen to Rap and Hip Hop everyday of my life. . . .

Don’t say that bro, naa! These are things you say amongst friends not in public. The likes of 2pac, Notorious B.I.G, Dr Dre,Snoop, Nas, Jay Z, and co made it there and still rep’s it. Stop trippin …say you don’t listen to Nigerian rappers not rap songs in general”</p><p>vsace_ike wrote: “I cant agree with this, it’s not dead, it’s just not your type of music , not everybody likes Afrobeats. it would make sense for someone like you to love Afro beats compared to somebody who grew up in a environment where they could relate to rap music”</p><p>cynthialopez_official_ wrote: “Mumu have audacity to say same flow and same line for ode wey don over use she say she say,nothing person no go see for this small pikin hand”</p><p>nzeakokosi7 wrote: “This might come out disrespectful, but you need some level of intellectual prowess to actually understand and enjoy rap, that shit is hardcore poetry with rhythm and cadence. It’s not for everyone, I enjoy Afro beats but it’s just repetitive hooks/Chorus and beats, not much wordplay is required. I’d say the heroes of Afro beats are the producers and beat makers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49qZrChqqC2pXnSqZiro6NiuqrExJ1kq52RmMGqu82sZJqrXZ2ybrDEnKOaqpWoerOtz2akrquZmHqlscCdZJqmlGKvsL7Ip55o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
