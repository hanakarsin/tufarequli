The reality star has officially said goodbye to the farmhouse.</h2><p>While it feels like ages ago the pair announced their engagement, there has not been a wedding yet. Instead, Amy and Chris are enjoying their time together, participating in fun outdoor adventures like riding motorcycles and skydiving. Additionally, the couple is settling into their new home after Amy officially said goodbye to the farmhouse.</p><p>So, is the couple gearing up for a wedding sometime soon?</p><p>Amy previously revealed she and Chris aren't planning to have the wedding until 2021.</p><p>“Chris and I are planning to get married in 2021,” she revealed in February. “We haven’t set a date yet.

It's currently unclear if she plans to hold either the reception or the ceremony on <a href=#>the family farm</a>, as all of her children have, but she did allude to a possible crossover with Say Yes to the Dress.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“I’m sure a few of you have heard of Kleinfeld in New York, and Randy [Fenoli] because he designs dresses,” she said, admitting she would love to have her wedding gown made for her. “Could he design a dress for a little person? Randy, if you’re listening out there, we’d love to hear from you. We’d love to come to New York.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Amy has said she won't do an impulse wedding.</h2><p>During a Facebook Live with her friend, Amy made it clear she has no plans to rush into the wedding and intends to keep it traditional.</p><p>“I’m much more of a traditional person … I want the wedding and the reception,” she said, as reported by Good Housekeeping. “I would like to share that experience with [Chris].”</p><p>While the pair has yet to work out all of the details of their wedding, it's possible we'll get to see Amy walk down the aisle with her new man in a season of Little People, Big World.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Tonight!
