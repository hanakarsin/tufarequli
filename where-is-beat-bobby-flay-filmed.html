Indeed, the hit cooking competition is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filmed in Bobby's hometown of New York City</a>. Filming most recently took place at a studio in Long Island City, Queens. The show has previously shot at sets across Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p><p>No matter what studio at which they film, the setup in the Beat Bobby Flay kitchen is something to marvel at. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Network Dish</a>, the kitchen is typically stocked with more than 100 pieces of cooking equipment and over 200 grocery items. This makes a lot of sense when you consider the spectrum of dishes Bobby and his competitors prepare on the show, including everything from falafel to shrimp and grits.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can you get tickets to 'Beat Bobby Flay'?</h2><p>Not only can you get tickets to attend a taping of Beat Bobby Flay, but you'll actually get paid for it!

In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a> earlier this year, he shared that they "usually shoot two [episodes] per day with a break in between." (Keep in mind that, aside from the meal break, audience members will be standing for the duration of filming.)</p><p>As of this writing, taping for Beat Bobby Flay is on hiatus.
