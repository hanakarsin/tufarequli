Source: ABCTV directors, costumers, and propmasters are pretty good at hiding an actor's pregnancy when it doesn't fit into the storyline. Rather than sidelining a character while the actor playing them is expecting, they use angles, clothing tricks, and strategically placed objects to obscure tell-tale baby bumps."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Is she pregnant? Here's the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>TV directors, costumers, and propmasters are pretty good at hiding an actor's pregnancy when it doesn't fit into the storyline. Rather than sidelining a character while the actor playing them is expecting, they use angles, clothing tricks, and strategically placed objects to obscure tell-tale baby bumps.</p><p>So when viewers notice a femme actor dressing a bit baggier or getting really into accessories, audiences tend to perk up. That seems to have been the case during <a href=#>The Good Doctor</a>, which saw Dr. Morgan Reznick (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiona Gubelmann</a>) carrying around a big medical chart for a while.</p><p>Is Fiona Gubelmann pregnant? Here's what you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Fiona Gubelmann pregnant?</h2><p>In this instance, the choice to carry around objects such as a clipboard is not a pregnancy-hiding tactic but a character choice. Fiona Gubelmann does not appear to be pregnant, nor has she told fans on social media of any impending pregnancies. However, that's not to say she couldn't be in the future.</p><p>It's unclear when the actress and her husband, Alex Weed, were married, but they've been together since college. They met at UCLA where Fiona, once a pre-med student, auditioned for a play and realized she needed to pursue her passion.</p><p>Changing paths also led Fiona to her spouse, who has appeared on a multitude of television shows throughout the years. Good Doctor fans will probably recognize Alex, because he actually appeared in the two-part "Quarantine" episode during Season 2 as Chris Santos.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Fiona Gubelmann (@fionagubelmann)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@fionagubelmann</a></figure><p>However, there is a logical explanation for why fans might suspect Fiona is pregnant. During Season 6 of The Good Doctor, her characteris undergoing IVF treatments in hopes of becoming pregnant. Recently, Dr. Reznick discovered the treatments have not been working. However, when she's offered the dream job of a lifetime, Morgan must decide which she wants to put first: her growing family or her career.</p><p>At first, Dr. Reznick turns down the job offer from Dr. Andrews (Hill Harper), but she eventually changes her mind when he explains she can be a great mother and have a high-profile career. Fans will have to remember that characters undergoing pregnancies on television shows doesn't necessarily mean the same of their real lives!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Ultimately, it's unclear whether Fiona and Alex desire kids now or in the future, but we're sure that if the time comes, we'll be seeing Morgan carrying a lot of medical charts and pushing crash carts around!</p><p>The Good Doctor airs Mondays at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBussiopZpll6qvprjMmqWnZaCnsqi6wKer</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
