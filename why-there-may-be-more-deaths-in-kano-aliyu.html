It wasn’t very clear whether they acquired it in the facility or if it was brought in. This has raised concerns, so we have taken measures to disinfect the place.”</p><p>He noted that the samples can still be collected, he added that measures have been put in place to ensure samples are taken.</p><p>“The laboratory will not be closed for too long because three or four days is enough to decontaminate the facility.”</p><p>“There are several scenarios that could be happening; one is that there could be increase in numbers of death due to COVID-19, the other possibility is that it may not be caused by the virus,” he said.</p><p>“You are aware that a lot of hospitals in Kano have closed so people with medical concerns are having difficulty accessing care, so the deaths may not be related to the virus. We are awaiting the investigation to ascertain the true picture.”</p><p>Aliyu further disclosed that there are only 350 ventilators in the country before the outbreak of the disease in Nigeria, but that another 100 have been added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e5FsZrCgqWLBqbHRnmSmmalir6Z5zKipnmWUmq61tNJmoKdlm5a7sHnApaCyrV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
