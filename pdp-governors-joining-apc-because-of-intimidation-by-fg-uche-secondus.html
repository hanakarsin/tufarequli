I have never seen where you have economic crises, insecurity crises, then the ruling party goes poaching governors, and 18 governors as published on social media will be moving, leaving their states to celebrate the killings of innocent citizens in Zamfara state or hunger in Zamfara state? This is a shame and it is laughable.</p><p>“They are going after our governors, but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote, but we are after the people; the masses, the people who are suffering under this government. And the masses are solidly behind us, the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form this new government coming in 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Governor of Rivers State, <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong>, on Tuesday said <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>his counterparts who dumped the Peoples Democratic Party</a></strong> for the All Progressives Congress lacks conscience.</p><p>Wike while speaking at the flag-off of Woji-Aleto-Alesa-Refinery Road and bridge on Tuesday, said those defecting from PDP after winning through the party’s platform are hopeless and shameless human beings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5JpZqmcoGK0sMLEq6WoqqNit7C1zaKloGWRpbBursScmK6rlWK8p3nIp6uipZmZrrW1zqdkm7Fdm7RuwcKhnGarlZi8r7DUrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
