You know, Nigeria, they have a good squad, but also on our side, we have a good squad, so it’s going to be a very good game,” Mashego told reporters in the mixed zone.</p><p>He continued: “We also have a good defense; now we’ve gone three games without conceding, so we have a very good defense; we are ready for any battle.</p><p>“We don’t want to pressurize ourselves; we just have to take one game at a time, and maybe we might find ourselves in the final.”</p><p>South Africa central defender, Grant Kekana added, “Obviously it’s another tough opponent. We know Nigeria has a lot of quality players, we know they’ve done well to also get this far but we believe in ourselves.</p><p>“We are going to go to the drawing board, plan accordingly, and give ourselves a chance of getting a positive result against them.”</p><p>The Super Eagles of Nigeria vs Bafana Bafana of South 2023 AFCON semi-final clash will kick off at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, February 7.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49uZqynpam1bq3Fq6CcmZ5iva2t2J6prGWklrmsedOorKCgXZa1pq3DZqafZWJlf3R5wJ%2BaqKZdmLmiv8dmrqKsmGK7qrPEq6CaZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
