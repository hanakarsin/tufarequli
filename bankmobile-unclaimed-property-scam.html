So it's only natural for this Redditor to receive correspondence from a company called Bank Mobile that alleged there was some unclaimed property they could get their hands on, and think it's fishy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They're everywhere.</a> There are email scams, text message scams, Instagram comment scams, Twitter DM scams, everywhere you look it seems like someone's trying to get a hold of your personal information.</p><p>So it's only natural for this Redditor to receive correspondence from a company called Bank Mobile that alleged there was some unclaimed property they could get their hands on, and think it's fishy.</p><p>When trying to get to the bottom of any "offer" to find out if it's a scam, all you really need to do is some Googling to find out whether or not the agencies involved are legitimate. If they have terrible BBB ratings then there's a good chance that the "business" involved is a total scam. If you're getting phone calls, just searching that particular number will let you know if there's something fishy you should be aware of.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But is the Bank Mobile "unclaimed property" message necessarily a scam?</h2><p>As it turns out, Bank Mobile is a completely legitimate, real financial entity. One Redditor questioned in a post they put up in r/scams, "I received a letter from a bank called "Bank Mobile - a Customer Bank" claiming that I had unclaimed property in the form of a checking account since 2015. My first reaction was, 'Huh?'. I don't even have a bank account."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bank Mobile</span></figure><p>They continued, "I gave them a call, and they wanted to verify my information to see if I am the true owner of the account. They asked for my name and school, and when they asked for my birthdate, I snapped and told them I wasn't going to give them personal information. I hung up."</p><p>As it turns out, however, Bank Mobile wasn't trying to scam them:</p><p>"So it turns out, it was legitimate, lmao. The unclaimed property was unused financial aid money that I forgot about since 2015. I called my school to verify, and they exclaimed that it was indeed legitimate. I called the bank and the same guy answered the call. I apologized profusely for cussing him out. He said not to worry about it as he would have done the same thing if he thought he was being scammed. In the end, I got A LOT of money back that I'm giving back to my loan provider."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shoutout to the American Eagle in my small town mall for not paying me my last paycheck in 2012 so that 8 years later I could find it as unclaimed property and be $189 richer in the middle of a global pandemic</p>— Katie Gray (@HeyitsKatieGray) <a href=#>May 28, 2020</a></figure><p>Other Reddit posts about Bank Mobile have popped up, but rest assured, the financial institution actually has a history of dispersing pell grants, loans, and other forms of college funds. Obviously with any "cash offer" you need to make sure it's actually Bank Mobile that you're speaking to and not some guy pretending to be Bank Mobile, so if you are suspicious, hang up and call the actual number of Bank Mobile.
