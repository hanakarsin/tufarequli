There is nothing I can do about it. I love my mum. If I was asked to give anything in exchange for her life, I would have gladly done that. But that’s what God wanted so I have to let her go. She had suffered a lot. I did my best to take care of her. It’s not easy losing mum or someone close to your heart.</p><p>“With a heavy heart, I’ve accepted her passing as God’s will. The pain she endured in her last days made it clear that letting her go was the kindest thing to do, despite how much it hurt.</p><p>“I was by her side, cooking for her, ensuring she took her medication, and taking care of her personal needs. It was important for me to ensure she felt loved and cared for during those tough times.</p><p>“Her constant calls to ensure I was safe and sound, her inability to sleep until I returned home, truly showed the depth of her love and concern for me. Now, I miss those calls, those check-ins that reminded me I was loved”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FwZqWdpKm2r7OMprBmpaWieqi7jLCYrGWknbJut8inm56rpGLBqbXNoGStp12ZvG68wKysppldqL2mrcqsZKimXaWuqrrFrqNmpJ%2BowHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
