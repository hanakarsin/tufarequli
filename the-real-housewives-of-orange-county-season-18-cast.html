Source: BravoIt feels like we were on a fictional beach-themed soundstage with Andy Cohen and The Real Housewives of Orange County Season 17 cast just yesterday. However, in reality, it's been almost a year since we've seen the cast of Bravo's first 'wives installment, and we've been impatiently awaiting for their return."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the drama didn't stop there, and some of the reasons had to do with former 'wives star <a href=#>Alexis Bellino</a>.</p><p>After leaving RHOC in 2013 and starring on it full-time for Seasons 5-8, Alexis returned to the show as a "friend." In addition to reuniting with Tamra and Heather Dubrow, Alexis will share her romance with <a href=#>Shannon Storms Beador's ex</a>, <a href=#>John Janssen</a>.

Shannon became single in 2022 after she and John (you know, Alexis' <a href=#>current main squeeze</a>) ended their three-year relationship. She was also arrested in October 2023 for a DUI hit-and-run, which the trailer shows her discussing on RHOC.

Her husband, Matt Ginella, is also a professional journalist.</p><p>While Katie already has a friend in the cast, she reportedly gets on Heather's bad side this season.

Now that she's "no longer a <a href=#>Tres Amiga</a>," Tammy's season will show her exploring other friendships within the circle, including her reconnection with Heather. However, she and Jennifer Pedranti are trying to move forward after Tamra shares her disapproval of Jennifer's relationship with <a href=#>Ryan Boyaijian</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Gina Kirschenheiter</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Bravo</a></figure><p>Although she has another friend around in Season 18, <a href=#>Gina Kirschenheiter</a> will still deal with several relatable moments as the season progresses. The realtor's professional career is on the upswing, but her personal life will take a hit.
