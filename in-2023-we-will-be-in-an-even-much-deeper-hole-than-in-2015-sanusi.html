This country needs good politicians. It needs imams, pastors and bishops who are going to stand up and remind them (politicians) of the fear of God. It needs technocrats who are going to critique their policies. It needs traditional rulers who are going to speak as the conscience of the people. Everyone has a role to play and we should try to play that role to the best of our ability.”</p><p>This online news platform had earlier reported that Sanusi, however, denied eyeing the 2023 presidency, saying <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>he is not interested</a></strong> in joining politics or succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.</p><p>The former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor said he is okay being an elder statesman and the spiritual leader of the Tijaniyyah movement in Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49wZqKmXWd9c3%2BMsJxmr5mhuW6uxGagp2WRo3qmwsSnZKatk516pbHEqZyrZZikuaZ506GYp2WZo3pzfJBuZKyZnqrAqns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
