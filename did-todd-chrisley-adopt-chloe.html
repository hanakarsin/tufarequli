But, over the years, he has proven that he always does what he does to put his kids‚Äô needs before his own and the same goes for Todd‚Äôs granddaughter, Chloe."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But, over the years, he has proven that he always does what he does to put his kids‚Äô needs before his own and the same goes for <a href=#><u>Todd‚Äôs granddaughter, Chloe</u></a>.</p><p>She has been a part of the show off and on over the years, but in recent seasons, Chloe is more of a permanent cast member. Naturally, fans have started to wonder if this means Todd and his wife, Julie Chrisley, adopted Chloe. She is his oldest son‚Äôs daughter and seems to be under their care most of the time, but it hasn't been addressed much on Chrisley Knows Best.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, did Todd Chrisley adopt Chloe?</h2><p>When Chloe was six months old, Todd and Julie gained custody of her and have been raising her ever since. Despite raising his granddaughter as one of his own, Todd has faced backlash from people who have demanded to know how he plans to raise Chloe, who is mixed race, to understand the reality of racism in the United States amidst the George Floyd protests.</p><p>Todd‚Äôs daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Savannah Chrisley</u></a><u>,</u> wrote on Instagram that the entire family has made it a point to teach Chloe about being Black in America as best as they can.</p><p>"My dad and I sat and had a lengthy conversation about it and we were heartbroken and scared for Chloe's future," she wrote on Instagram in May. "We live in a world to where we have to teach her to be extra cautious around police officers because [of] the color of her skin."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My forever girl üíñ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ She goes - ‚ÄúSassy...I personally think that is a great photo for Instagram.‚Äù üòÇ</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Savannah Faith Chrisley</a> (@savannahchrisley) on Jul 2, 2020 at 4:01pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chloe's dad isn't on 'Chrisley Knows Best.'</h2><p>Todd‚Äôs oldest son, Kyle Chrisley, was introduced back in Season 1, but hasn't been on the show since. He has struggled with addiction and, Todd explained once, he had no intention of putting his son on the show while he dealt with trying to get sober. In 2014, Todd told E! News that Kyle is bipolar and that, from a young age, he tried to use substances to self-medicate.</p><p>Although they were estranged for a long time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kyle and Todd opened up</u></a> about their issues on a September 2019 episode of the Chrisley Confessions podcast and, at the time, Kyle said he was getting sober. Even if he is off drugs now and doing better than he was when Chloe was a baby and he was unable to care for her, it looks like Todd retains custody of her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Isn‚Äôt she the cutest thing you‚Äôve ever seen?</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Kyle Chrisley</a> (@kyle.chrisley) on Jul 18, 2020 at 4:32pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Chloe Chrisley's mom?</h2><p>Like Kyle, not much has been said about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chloe‚Äôs mom on </u><u>Chrisley Knows Best</u></a>.

Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitter page</u></a> was last active in 2016, when she posted photos of Chloe. She has also dealt with legal troubles of her own and, for now at least, it looks like Chloe has a permanent home with Grandpa Todd.</p><p>Watch Chrisley Knows Best on Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on USA.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is struggling with alcohol or drug abuse, call&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SAMHSA‚Äôs National Helpline</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;at 1-800-662-4357.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledOom51lk52%2Fqr%2FLnrBmmZSkvbV5wqGjqJ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
