Look at his feet. Who in his right mind wears a suit and tie and then puts on a pair of gym shoes? If Shettima does not know how to dress himself to a formal conference, how will he be able to address Nigeria’s many challenges?</p><p>“Imagine if this were the United Nations General Assembly. What will his dress sense project about Nigeria? A man who cannot package himself is very unlikely to package progress for a nation that has been damaged by the All Progressives Congress government of General Buhari! If you are a foreign investor, would you want to invest in a country where the Vice President is seen in public like this? The man heard NBA and thought it was National Basketball Association. That is why he wore gym shoe on top of suit and tie. Running mate wearing running shoes! No be juju be that?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FrZqudnqR6sLnOpKmiZaOhrq6%2FjKSYrKCZonq0tMStq6KlkWKzsL6MqaytrJmjtG67zWaesqVdqLWwsdJmq6hlnpeubq%2FOp52eqpWjsKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
