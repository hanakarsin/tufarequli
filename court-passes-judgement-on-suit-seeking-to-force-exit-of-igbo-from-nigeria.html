The plea for secession was presented in a lawsuit identified as FHC/ABJ/CS/538/2021, which was initiated by a coalition of elders and politicians from the North.</p><p>Within the lawsuit, they argued that allowing the Igbo people to secede from Nigeria would help in ending violence and devastation in the South-East.</p><p>Furthermore, they elaborated that this move would prevent a recurrence of the 1967-1970 Civil War in Nigeria, which resulted in widespread loss of lives and property.</p><p>Additionally, the groups asserted that this decision would quell the unrest caused by the Indigenous People of Biafra (<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>IPOB</a></strong>), under the leadership of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nnamdi Kanu.</strong></a></p><p>The group, among others, prayed for “A declaration that combined effect of the provisions of Section 4 of the Nigerian Constitution and Articles 1, 2, and 20 (1) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act 2004, “is empowered to set in motion a framework for a referendum to allow the south-eastern region of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to decide on their bid for self-determination.”</p><p>They also urged the court to order the second, third, and fourth defendants (the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the National Assembly) “to provide a framework that will pave way for the self-determination of the south-eastern states so as to leave the geographical entity called Nigeria before any further step is taken to amend the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”</p><p>According to Daily Post, the plaintiffs said,<i>&nbsp;“The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria can be further amended at any time after the question of self-determination must have been resolved by Nigerians.”</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BrZpynpafBbrzArKqeq12fwqWzxKacp6xdpLtuv9Siq2arlZq4qrrGZquoZZakv6SxjJ6voqxdpLNutcabpmaeoqS6brrIoJyroZFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
