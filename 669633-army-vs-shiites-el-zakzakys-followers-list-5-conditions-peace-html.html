We ask the military to release all our arrested members. We ask for the army to stop molestation of our members; all corpses of our brothers and sisters killed by the army should be released for proper Islamic burial. We want full compensation for the lives lost as well as our properties destroyed, and we want a full-scale investigation and prosecution of culprits involved in the killing of our members,”</i> they said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Zaria Massacre: Over 200 Muslim Leaders To Attend Emergency Meeting</p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p>Giwa lamented that since the Saturday incident, members of their sect have continued to suffer more deaths. According to him, on Tuesday, December 15, men of the Nigerian Police Mobile Force attacked their members and killed four.</p><p><i>“We had no premeditated plan to attack the chief of army staff as claimed by the army.</i></p><p><i>“On that fateful day when we were getting set to celebrate the Maulud of our holy prophet at the Husseiniyya prayer ground, the Nigerian army came and stationed a detachment of soldiers there and the military presence created tension amongst our members. Even when the COAS came to pass, there was no incident at all. But two hours later, soldiers came back and began to open fire on our members. More than 300 people were killed there,”</i> he said.</p><p>Recalling the raid on El-Zakzaky’s residence by the Nigerian army, Giwa expressed assurance that the death toll was four times more than what was recorded at Husseiniyya. He further claimed that most of the dead bodies were evacuated and taken to unknown places by the army.</p><p>The two spokesmen revealed that El-Zakzaky had called some of the members shortly before soldiers arrested him.
