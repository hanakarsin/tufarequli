There are some things I did before that I don’t do again, such as posting videos of myself online dancing and wearing only boxers. It (fatherhood) has made me upgrade my craft. I also can’t keep doing the same things because people get tired with time.”</p><p>He also stated that he had no plans to separate his comedy from music.</p><p>He said, “Music is a gift from God to me. When I came out with the ‘states and capital’ song, it went viral beyond my expectations. I know it is a funny song but then, I am a comedian. I usually obey my instincts. And, when I feel like it, I call another artiste. Music and comedy are not distinct for me, and I won’t be separating them.”</p><p>Speaking on why he likes Lagos, the Delta State-born content creator said, everyone in Lagos is determined and hardly joke with their business.</p><p>He said, “Everyone in Lagos is a ‘hustler’. Everyone is determined and don’t joke with their business. I love Lagos, because it is a place where one can easily make it. People don’t sleep in Lagos. Even me, I barely sleep at night.”</p><p>Asked what he looks out for in a partner when going into a relationship, he said, “I look out for character and her relationship with God before getting into a relationship. However, I am currently in one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FpZqGnp2KzosDHnqmhp5%2BZeq6tw55kpp1dqr2ovsCdnGalqWKws63FrWScmaKpsrN5xJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
