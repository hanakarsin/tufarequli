That couple is still going strong and hopefully will continue to, but what about their counterparts across the pond? Are Love Island U.K.'s winning couple, Mimii Ngulube and Josh Oyinsan, still together?</p><p>Love Island U.K. is the original in the franchise. The show first premiered in a celebrity format called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Love Island</a> that premiered in 2005. Unfortunately, at that time, the series did not do well and was canceled after two seasons. The celebrity aspect was removed, and in 2015 Love Island premiered, and this time, it was a big success. Since then, it has grown to 22 series spread across the globe under its umbrella. Love Island U.K. is also the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most successful</a> in creating long-lasting couples.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ITV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are 'Love Island U.K.' winners Mimii Ngulube and Josh Oyinsan still together after the finale?</h2><p>After a beautiful journey together in the villa, Mimii and Josh took home the grand prize to share as a couple. Their story <a href=#>was inspirational</a> to watch, and as of right now, it appears that they are still together. They spoke with former islander Indiyah Polack <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on a podcast</a>, where they touched on their relationship status. They are taking their time, according to Josh, who said, "We love the fact that everyone loves us together, but the pace that we're going at is good for me; it's good for her."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ITV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There was an attempt at a narrative in which Mimii still had feelings for Ayo Odukoya, but fans were not fooled.</h2><p>As one of the original arrivals on the island, Mimii developed an immediate connection with <a href=#>Ayo Odukoya</a>, and coupled up with him. Mimii believed in her connection with Ayo and stayed faithful to him while he had his own dalliances in Casa Amor. Thankfully, Josh put in his work to show her that he was the right choice, and after she was called out for an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">embarrassing situation</a> (i.e., a failed "secret mission" to meet up with Ayo on the terrace), she found her way to Josh. Some fans believed there had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a narrative being</a> built that Mimii still wanted Ayo, but these viewers were not fooled.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ITV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">While some feel they weren't deserving, Mimii and Josh got overwhelming amount of support from 'Love Island' fans after their win.</h2><p>A few fans of the series were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not too keen</a> on Mimii after the failed "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secret mission</a>," but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">those rooting</a> for her saw the opportunity to set up a strong foundation of honesty with Josh. They were able to talk through their issues, which added to the joy of watching their connection deepen. Not only was it beautiful to watch the <a href=#>seeds of love</a> sprout, but they are also making history as the first entirely Black couple to win Love Island U.K.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforautchmmKecXZ%2B8tLSMpaavnV2ewK2tzZ1krqNdqMGquMtmq6iflam1pr4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
