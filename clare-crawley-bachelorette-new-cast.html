Here is everything we know regarding the 38-year-old reality star's upcoming season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why is Clare Crawley's season of 'The Bachelorette' getting recast?</h2><p>The main reason why Chris Harrison believes they will have to recast for Clare's season is due to the fact that filming is essentially postponed indefinitely. He basically said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the likelihood of getting the same guys</a> to take time off at a later date is slim.</p><p>‚ÄúThe thought that 25, 30, 35 guys, everybody that was able to take time off and come on The Bachelorette, is going to be able to come back again ‚Äî because we don‚Äôt have a set time of when we‚Äôre going to come back," he said, according to Just Jared.&nbsp;</p><p>"Obviously with this virus, who knows when this thing is going to blow through. So the idea that everybody is just going to be able to take off work and do this again? Probably very slim."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But, Chris noted 'The Bachelorette' cast might not be entirely different.</h2><p>There is a chance, however, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the entire cast won't be erased</a> ‚Äî per Just Jared, Chris doesn't know what's going to happen, but he says that maybe a few of them will be able to stick around, and he'll only have to recast a handful of people. He doesn't know anybody's schedule, however, and nothing can be determined until filming resumes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Well hello! Talk about most dramatic season ever! In all seriousness, Everyone‚Äôs health is the most important priority at this time, and as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard, we are pressing pause for now on filming The Bachelorette. üåπ We are taking it day by day and even hour by hour as this is so unpredictable. All I know for sure is that my heart is so full from all the love and support this far, and am still so excited for my journey to begin!

According to Page Six, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juan Pablo tweeted about her "getting hit on" by kids</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúI just SAW the GUYS for @Clare_Crawley Bachelorette season and its gonna be INTERESTING seeing HER get hit on by KIDS on their 20s‚Ä¶ I think this MIGHT be the 3rd SEASON Im gonna watch [sic]," he tweeted.</p><p>Could the age difference have also inspired a recast? As of right now, the potential new cast is most likely attributed to scheduling issues, but this could also be a good time to get some older contestants in there.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just SAW the GUYS for <a href=#>@Clare_Crawley</a> Bachelorette season and its gonna be INTERESTING seeing HER get hit on by KIDS on their 20s...
