Unlike other games which one might outgrow, this one will forever be a favourite for many.</p><h2>50 good dares</h2><p class=align-left>To create a good dare, you need to personalize it according to the personality of the person to whom it is directed. Usually, the dare you pick should go against the person's personality and get them out of their comfort zone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ca7131bb0bc9186.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 beautiful songs about missing someone to help you get through it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What are some good dares?

Instead of this, you can dare them to apply petroleum jelly to their hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ca7131bb0bc9186.jpg><ul><li><strong>Place a hot Cheeto in your nose for 5 minutes.</strong></li></ul><p class=align-left>This is bound to hurt!</p><ul><li><strong>Stop a car that drives by and tell them that their wheels are turning.</strong></li></ul><p class=align-left>Fingers crossed you don't meet an angry driver.</p><ul><li><strong>Call the guy you have a crush on and tell him how many pairs of shoes you have.</strong></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2c21d42664874c94.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 weird games to play when you are bored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Wow...this is definitely one to use during a girls sleepover.

Hit all those awesome Elsa notes and let the one who dared you know that you are a singer in the works.</p><p class=align-left>To make your dare questions even funnier, combine two crazy ones into one. For example, you could dare someone to do a handstand with a mouth full of water while the rest of the group tells them funny jokes - but they are not allowed to spill the water.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3b5ed6bf383575ac.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Good night quotes for your loved ones</span></p></a><h3>Crazy dares</h3><p class=align-left>Truth or Dare dares are known to be crazy, and somewhat even impossible.
