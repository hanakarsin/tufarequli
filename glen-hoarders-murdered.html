Those of us with a shameless Hoarders addiction may remember the heart-wrenching Season 3 story of 54-year-old Glen Brittner, a Los Angeles, Calif. businessman whose wife had passed away several years prior. As a coping mechanism, the widower started raising rats as pets, but they rapidly multiplied."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But on Aug. 18, 2015, Brittner was the victim of a home invasion. Hours after the fact, he was found by one of his employees with his hands and feet tied together with zip-ties. The wheelchair he had been using was nowhere in sight, and his head was also bleeding from severe trauma.</p><p>When Brittner was discovered, he was still alive but in critical condition, and he was unable to speak. He died after living for 10 days in a coma. Authorities believe at least two men invaded Brittner's home. The invaders had apparently stolen $2,000, a few TVs, and some power tools.</p><p>As of 2018, according to AV Times, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the murder has not yet been solved</a>. Three years after his death, Brittner's son, George, as well as other family members of Brittner, came forward with a public appeal for information.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I think people should come forward with information to protect themselves and the community from the murderers... Justice is screaming for closure to this evil deed," Gary Brittner, Glen's brother, said in an official statement to authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>“How could someone be so cowardly and vile as to attack and beat a nearly 60-year-old crippled man to death?” Hopefully, Brittner's case is closed soon, and that justice is served to those involved with his death.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittner's 'Hoarders' story showcased his compassionate and sensitive personality.</h2><p>Before he died, Brittner appeared in the Hoarders episode that aired during Season 3, titled "Glen/Lisa." According to Fandom, Brittner had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">living with 2,500 free-roaming rats</a> after he attempted breeding them as pets after the death of his wife. He was forced to move into a shed on his property because the infestation had gotten totally out of control.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hoarders team ended up helping Brittner remove the rodents from his home, and during the episode, he insisted that they did it in a safe and ethical manner. He also demanded that each rat was adopted by new, loving families.&nbsp;</p><p>Brittner had a heart of gold, and he will forever be missed.
