Now that viewers have seen Ciara Miller and Lindsay Hubbard's disagreement over Austen Kroll play out, there's a new mystery brewing on Summer House Season 6: where is Alex Wach?!
When the fitness trainer joined the cast in Season 6, he immediately made an impression on his co-stars with his regimented and protein-packed diet, and his passion for exercise."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the stars did not discuss Alex's presence, and he was not featured during any of the major scenes from the party.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>Luke Gulbranson and Alex Wach talk to a party guest on 'Summer House' Season 6.</p></figure><p>Though some viewers did question whether Alex was getting edited out of the show on purpose, Kyle Cooke had a different explanation. The Drink Loverboy founder noted that it was likely difficult for the camera operators to follow all of the stars around.</p><p>"It's happened in the past and IMO [in my opinion] has nothing to do with production not wanting to pay their episodic fee. Again, this is speculation, but it's likely because there was so much going on and production wasn't following them," Kyle wrote in an Instagram comment, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@BravoHistorian</a> on Instagram (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>). "From a producer's perspective, it probably seems even weirder to have a cast member there and get no camera time than to edit them out."</p><p>Kyle added that Lindsay's ex and Winter House alum Jason Cameron was also at the event, though he was not featured on the show either.</p><p>"Last episode had 11 cast and 3 guests if you included Jason," he continued. "And as we all know, last episode had a ton of moving pieces and there was just too many people to follow."</p><p>The Summer House O.G. said that this sort of thing has happened before, even to himself. As viewers will know, Lindsay's party led to a lot of drama between the birthday girl herself, her ex-fling/guest Austen, and his Winter House love interest, Ciara.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>Lindsay Hubbard and Alex Wach in the pool during a 'Summer House' event.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Alex still on 'Summer House'?</h2><p>Alex is still listed as an official cast member for Season 6 on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BravoTV.com</a>, and no announcement has been publicly made regarding any midseason demotion.</p><p>It remains to be seen just how much of a role the fitness aficionado will have on the rest of the episodes in Season 6.</p><p>Summer House Season 6 airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.
