I have a word for those Yoruba rancorous elements, noisemakers who have not achieved much as Asiwaju Tinubu has achieved, but are always querying and worrying themselves about his ancestry.</p><p>“His traducers are quick to tell you, he’s from Iragbiji; that is where Jephthah came from, that is where he came from. As if that will resolve the issues we have today. Hear me loud and clear, knowing the name of Asiwaju’s mother or father or his place of birth cannot put food on the table of the hungry or create jobs for the unemployed.</p><p>“Despite his growing up challenges, the dents and the detours of his life, he like Jephthah delivered Lagos state and nearly all the southwest states from the onslaught of the PDP from 1999 to 2007.</p><p>“Truth be told, without his cooperation and political dexterity, the APC victory at the polls in 2015 and 2019 would have been impossible.”</p><p>Bakare noted that just as every saint has a past, every sinner has a future, “and the best of men are still men at the very best.”</p><p>He said those who are envious of Tinubu and those who desire to take his power slot should stop their “useless talk about him and busy” themselves with what can add value to society.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5FtZq%2BhlJq8bq3PnGSwp6Whsa%2FAjKGYr51drLyveZFpaG5lYmV%2BennEpZycrJmku7R51qKroaelqXq1tc2uma5lkpa4or7EaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
