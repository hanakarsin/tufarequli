But, things began to look up for Conrad after he and Nic welcomed their baby girl.</p><p>Sadly, their bliss didn't last, and Nic died after sustaining severe injuries in a car wreck. Although he initially refused to accept the reality of his wife's death, Episode 6 proves that he and <a href=#>Gigi</a> (Remington Evans) are doing just fine. In an attempt to spend more time with his daughter, Conrad resigned from his role at Chastain to treat patients at a private practice.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>If anyone deserves a fresh start, it's Conrad — and it seems like he'll finally get that in Season 5 of The Resident.</p><p>Although his new life allows him time to prioritize dinner dates with his daughter, he takes a walk down memory lane with an old friend who reminds him how much he misses the fast-paced environment he once loved.</p><p>Conrad assists Devon (Manish Dayal) and his team with an impossible case that they ultimately solve in the end.
