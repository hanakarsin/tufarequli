He also took a loan at AFC to irregularly obtain land belonging to a former vice president in Kilgoris. "The National Land Commission (NLC) made a finding that Weston Hotel sits on land belonging to the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA). An attempt was even made to grab the land belonging to Lang’ata Road Primary School; poor kids were teargassed, and we stood firm with them.”<h2>Kalonzo matches to DCI</h2><p class=align-left>Kalonzo on Wednesday matched to the DCI headquarters along Kiambu Road with <a href=#>a battery of lawyers.</a></p><p class=align-left>Some of the top lawyers who accompanied the former vice president were <a href=#>James Orengo</a> (Siaya), Dan Maanzo (Makueni MP) and Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni senator).</p><p class=align-left>It was not the first time Kalonzo presented himself at DCI.
