Anyone who dumped more than 20 hours into Breath of the Wild knows that one of the most annoying parts of the game was finding Korok seeds.
Koroks, the little forest spirits Link can see around Hyrule, left little puzzles for our hero to find."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Instead of solving a silly little puzzle to get them to reveal themselves, these Koroks are on a mission to see their friend (who is usually on a different island/landmass). For the sweet, sweet reward of two Korok Seeds, all players have to do is reunite the two.</p><p>But some are doing anything but reuniting the Korok with its friend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Nintendo via TikTok</a></figure><p>Thanks to Link's new Ultrahand ability, players can fuse a wide variety of materials together to make structures, vehicles, weapons — really, anything your imagination can dream up. Though NPCs are typically immune to Link's abilities, the Korok that needs to be reunited with its friend is the exception. As part of the puzzle solutions, players can use Ultrahand to fuse the Korok to their creation to help move it.</p><p>Instead, these poor Koroks are facing horrible, tragic deaths.</p><p>Some like to keep their revenge simple, throwing the Korok off the side of a Sky Island and walking away. Others, though, have more creative ideas.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@splongus_ href=#>@splongus_</a><p>The Koroks are facing the firing squad as punishment for the war crimes they’ve committed <a title=totk href=#>#totk</a> <a title=botw href=#>#botw</a> <a title=tearsofthekingdom href=#>#tearsofthekingdom</a> <a title=zelda href=#>#zelda</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Splongus" href=#>♬ original sound - Splongus</a></figure><p>Plenty of players have decided to crucify their Koroks, attaching them to it and setting it on fire.
