And then celebrated this assembly line failure, which has dire and quite frankly terrifying implications for the rest of their cereal-making operation, by creating packaging and media campaigns around it? Or do they expect us to believe that the boxes were a mistake too? Unreal.</p><p>And whatever your thoughts on the flavor of Oops! All Berries cereal is, or the advertising campaign the folks at Quaker Oats came up with, there were definitely some people who were stoked to see that they could buy a package that was literally just filled with the berries from Berry Cap'n Crunch.</p><p>And there are some who seem equally excited at the prospect of getting a whole bag of just spicy Takis dust., like this TikToker claims to have found.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kiaraa_mooneyy</span></figure><p>In a now-viral clip posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kiaraa_mooneyy</a>, someone can be held taking a pair of scissors to a purple bag of Takis chips. The scissors cut through the top of the bag, to reveal a mound of a red powder, aka, the seasoning or "flavoring" added to the savory snacks. There are no tortilla pieces found in the bag — only a thick mass of powder.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/MFRVWxdpk/200x200/mustafa-gatollari-1653400847196.jpg><p>And while the red powder is surely inside of the bag and packed to the brim in the video, the clip actually begins with both sides of the bag already slightly opened, with someone using a pair of scissors to cut the rest of it open.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I finally broke down and bought myself an air fryer yesterday (previously bought 3 for other people).</p><p>This thing is AMAZING!
