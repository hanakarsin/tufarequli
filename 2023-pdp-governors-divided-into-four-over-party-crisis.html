Some are for Ayu, others for Wike, the so-called neutral group and some on a spying mission.”</p><p>The source noted that the former Board of Trustees Chairman, Walid Jibrin who had three months left in office was forced to resign to preserve the unity of the party.</p><p>He said the move to remove the National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu has become impossible because he has the support of the founders of PDP.</p><p>The top leader added, “These leaders also do not joke with party discipline.
