Then coming on the heels of the fight that you fought, that everybody fought, that the whole of Nigeria did not want a Third Term Agenda, you are now asking for a third term agenda? That’s the height of hypocrisy: that’s how they saw it.</p><p>“So I had to go round, it was a lot, trying to explain and educate the electorate. That no two-term limit is only applicable to the Executive under the constitution; it is clear in the constitution.</p><p>“That for the legislator, not just in Nigeria but worldwide, you can go fifty times if your people want you back. I gave them examples, and I made it clear to them that there is no term limit in the constitution for legislators, whereas there is a term limit for Governors and Presidents, and I gave them reasons why there is a difference, why there is a term limit for the Executive, and then they began to understand.</p><p>“What could be argued is that was he Obasanjo aware? Was he instrumental? Was he a part of it? Or as we know it in Nigerian politics and even politics worldwide, was it the people around him who turned a deaf ear? Or was it the people around him and he cautioned them?</p><p>“Obasanjo had reacted to the Third Term question by saying: ‘Well, I’m sick and tired of you people and Third Term because if I wanted Third Term, I would have got it by the grace of God. If I wanted it. There was nothing I wanted when I was President that I didn’t get, including very difficult debt relief. If I wanted Third Term, I would have got Third Term. Now the person who was my representative in the National Assembly, Ita Giwa, said to any of you that was my representative to the National Assembly, there was no day I called her and I said I wanted Third Term.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BtZqysn6W9qrrGZqabmaOWu6u70maroaGimXq1sdGmZJqflaOxonnApaSoq6RiwbC7ymaksmWcnrOmecabmKOZkp6urrXLmmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
