A chieftain of the opposition party in Lagos, Ganiu Taofik, said the incumbent Governor could have done better if he was in the umbrella camp.
According to him, the All Progressive Congress, APC where Sanwo-Olu currently is, is a selfish camp and that is why the Lagos state leader can not do more than what he is doing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is because they have confidence and they have seen that the PDP is a better platform.</p><p>“Governor Sanwo-Olu probably could have done 100 per cent more than he has done if he were not to be in the APC because it is a structural thing; the PDP in Lagos has a controlling leadership for sanity, morality and service delivery but what they have in the APC is a selfish leadership. That is why Governor Sanwo-Olu cannot do more than what he is doing.”</p><p>Taofiq reiterates that if the governor is hoping to have a ticket to re-contest, the PDP will allow him to contest the primary election in the PDP like every other aspirant.</p><p>Everybody has a level playing field in the PDP, unlike the APC where nobody can become a councillor without the leader’s support.</p><p>“The PDP has a wide umbrella to cover every politician from the House of Assembly to the House of Representative and others.”</p><p>”As political permutations earnestly begin ahead of the 2023 elections, there are indications that Sanwo-Olu wants to return for another four years.</p><p>“I think we are doing a very good job, I dare say so. I think the citizens know what it is they will be missing if they don’t let us continue to wrap up all the things we are doing,” Sanwo-Olu said in a recent interview when asked if he has any plan to throw his hat into the ring in the next election.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49sZmtoYmh6sbDPZqafnpWnwG7AzmaqrqigpL%2B1edKapbCnXaS5tnnFqKlmmZ6kwamx0WarnqqdYravec6fnaKblWK2p3nHnmSdnZOWurG%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
