"Drivers License," which arrived with an emotionally visceral music video, is about a breakup that sounds awfully familiar. Fans are speculating that the song is about <a href=#>Joshua Bassett</a>, whom Olivia was rumored to date while they were filming the Disney+ series.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened with Joshua Bassett and Olivia Rodrigo?</h2><p>Fans believed Joshua Bassett and Olivia Rodrigo, who played on-screen couple Ricky and Nini in the High School Musical spinoff, dated and then broke up sometime in 2020. In August 2020, Olivia posted a video to TikTok that showed her playing "All I Want" from the HSMTMTS soundtrack. "And that‚Äôs on failed relationships," she captioned the TikTok.</p><p>In "Drivers License" there are several clues as to what happened between them ‚Äî and it seems like Sabrina Carpenter has something to do with it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@livbedumb href=#>@livbedumb</a><p>and that‚Äôs on failed relationships</p><a title="‚ô¨ All I Want by Olivia Rodrigo - Alyssa Elness ü¶ã" href=#>‚ô¨ All I Want by Olivia Rodrigo - Alyssa Elness ü¶ã</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Joshua and Sabrina reportedly dated after he and Olivia broke up. In November, Joshua posted a TikTok featuring himself and Sabrina dressed up as Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which might mean the two were in quarantine together. Olivia sings about a "blonde girl" she was intimidated by in "Drivers License," which many are interpreting as Sabrina, who has blonde hair.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@joshuatbassett href=#>@joshuatbassett</a><p>dream a dream u little bleep <a title=sharkboyandlavagirl href=#>#sharkboyandlavagirl</a> @sabrinacarpenter</p><a title="‚ô¨ Follow me plz - Ma‚Äôkaila Janai" href=#>‚ô¨ Follow me plz - Ma‚Äôkaila Janai</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>"And you'reprobablywiththat blonde girl / Whoalways made medoubt / She's so much older than me / She's everything I'm insecure about," Olivia sings. Sabrina has blonde hair, and she's four years older than 17-year-old Olivia, so the clues do check out.&nbsp;</p><p>Another clue in "Drivers License" is the line, "I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me" which might be referring to Joshua's songs "Common Sense" and "Anyone Else," which some believe are about Olivia. "Common Sense" is about the possibility of getting back together after a breakup, and "Anyone Else" seems to be about an ex moving on and being with another person.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Joshua Bassett/YouTube</span></figure><p>And then, Joshua made a questioning marketing move when he decided to promote the release of his new song titled "Lie Lie Lie" (which comes out on Jan. 14) which he happened to do on the same exact day Olivia promoted her new song.</p><p>One of the images in the slideshow features him in a car with a blonde girl, which weirdly echoes "Drivers License." One person commented, "are u trying to steal olivias thunder or what."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joshua Bassett (@joshuatbassett)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And yes, if you must know, Twitter is absolutely convinced "Drivers License" is all about Joshua Bassett.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me listening to olivia rodrigo drag joshua bassett in drivers license <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FAi1GLA79N</a></p>‚Äî kat¬π·¥∞ ‚ô°‚Äôs caag (@niallinpayne) <a href=#>January 8, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the clues in olivia rodrigo‚Äôs music video for drivers license üëÄ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OvIP1c6E0M</a></p>‚Äî kianna (@thisisnotkianna) <a href=#>January 9, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Notably, Joshua did congratulate Olivia on the release of "Drivers License," and if they did date (and if the song really is about him), that's definitely a mature move right there.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>üì£ | Joshua Bassett congratulates Olivia on her song ‚Äúdrivers license,‚Äù despite the song shading her and Bassett‚Äôs relationship. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/C0oPSD3M9G</a></p>‚Äî Olivia Rodrigo Updates (@OliviaRNews) <a href=#>January 9, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Apparently though, Olivia shared a bunch of people's IG stories about "Drivers License" except Joshua's.
