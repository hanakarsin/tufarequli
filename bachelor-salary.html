Source: ABCFormer Bachelorette contestant Clayton Echard’s debut on The Bachelor was met with mixed emotions. Although many were excited to see the former NFL player get in touch with his inner romantic — and hopefully, find love — others were unimpressed by the new series lead. Now that Season 26 is well underway, Clayton has made quite an impression on both viewers and the women vying for his heart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And <a href=#>the competition is close</a>. Promos for the final rose ceremony tease that the season finale will be a rollercoaster, to say the least.</p><p>Exactly how much money is Clayton being paid to ride that rollercoaster? Read on for details about the <a href=#>Bachelor’s six-figure salary</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The Bachelor is paid a six-figure salary.</h2><p>Reality Steve reported that the leading men on The Bachelor are offered a standard rate of $100,000, but that number varies depending on the candidate in question.</p><p>In an episode of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trading Secrets</a> podcast, Season 14 Bachelorette contestant Jason Tartick claimed that he, Colton Underwood, and Blake Horstmann had all been offered the standard rate. On the lower end, Dean Unglert — from Season 12 of The Bachelorette — said that he was offered $75,000.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how much Clayton Echard was paid to participate in Season 26, but he makes a pretty penny at his day job as a medical sales representative. To date, <a href=#>his net worth</a> is estimated to be anywhere between $1 and $2 million dollars.</p><p>But does The Bachelor franchise believe in equal pay?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How much does the Bachelorette get paid?</h2><p>Much like stars of The Bachelor, the stars of The Bachelorette are also typically offered around $100,00 for their time on the show, but again, some stars have been paid more than others.</p><p>In Amy Kaufman’s book — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor Nation: Inside the World of America's Favorite Guilty Pleasure </a>— she shared that Season 2’s Meredith Phillips made only $10,000 on The Bachelorette, while Emily Maynard from Season 8 secured a reported $250,000.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Emily Maynard</p></figure><p>Apparently, it pays to find love on national television… well, at least for some people.

In fact, many contestants actually have to lose money to join the cast, as they're forced to leave their jobs for the entirety of filming.</p><p>In addition, contestants also have to take care of their own hair and makeup — an expense that can be upwards of $10,000. Former Bachelor contestants have gotten candid about their experience and the extensive debt they’ve acquired as a result.</p><p>Season 14 contestant Bekah Martinez previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>, “Spending money was a little scary because I basically quit my nanny job to go on the show ... I was definitely pretty broke when I got home."</p><p>You can catch new episodes of The Bachelor on Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66ktMSlpqtlo5a5or7Y</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
