Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the Williams family and their drama.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Grace find out about her father‚Äôs affair in '9-1-1: Lone Star'?</h2><p>It all started in Season 2, Episode 5 when Grace's husband, <a href=#>Judd Ryder</a>, responded to an emergency call. What he didn‚Äôt expect to find was Grace‚Äôs father collapsed on a hotel bed next to his very panicked mistress. She explains that they were just ‚Äúfooling around.‚Äù</p><p>In the moment, Judd keeps his cool. While the rest of the team assumes that Benjamin has had a heart attack, Judd knows immediately to check his glucose levels and he was right. Benjamin was in hypoglycemic shock.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>The only way Judd knew that was because he was aware of Benjamin‚Äôs diabetes. In this case, their relationship may have helped save Benjamin‚Äôs life, but it also made the incident a little too personal.</p><p>After all, now Judd had to figure out how or if he should tell Grace what he knew.</p><p>In the hospital, Judd told Benjamin that he won't tell Grace ‚Ä¶ at least not yet. However, he emphasized that Grace won‚Äôt be kept in the dark forever.</p><p>Benjamin immediately lies when Grace and her mother, Denice Williams, show up.</p><p>When Benjamin doesn‚Äôt fess up, Judd keeps his mouth shut. He acts weird the rest of the episode while Grace is in total ignorance. However, Grace starts to put the pieces together and goes digging in the 9-1-1 call files.</p><p>That‚Äôs when she hears the voice of the mistress and uncovers the truth.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Grace tell her mom about the infidelity?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Grace invites her mom over, but she backs out of actually telling her. Her nerves definitely got the best of her this time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What caused Benjamin‚Äôs heart attack?</h2><p>It‚Äôs uncomfortable and tense for a long time in the family. Secrets like this are never easy. During Season 4, Grace talks to her father about his affair. The conversation is full of tension with Grace saying some harsh words.</p><p>Later in the episode, a call comes into the center and it's about Benjamin again. Instead of being with another woman, he's with his wife. He has collapsed again, which causes a whole whirlwind of panic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>‚ÄúI saw it instantly in his eyes. It broke his heart. Two hours later, he has a coronary,‚Äù Grace says as she watches her dad lay in the hospital bed. She blames herself for the heart attack. She thinks that the extra stress may have caused it.</p><p>Of course, this isn‚Äôt the official reason and is more likely related to other health issues.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Benjamin OK?</h2><p>The incident gives Grace a new point of view. She extends forgiveness to her father as she sits by his bedside. After a while, she begins to sing ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù by Nat King Cole and is joined by her sisters.</p><p>In a very touching moment, Benjamin opens his eyes. It seems like he is going to be OK.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine waking up to three angels singing for you. üò≠ <a href=#>#911LoneStar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JRmGxDZyIj</a></p>‚Äî 9-1-1: Lone Star (@911LoneStar) <a href=#>April 19, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Grace‚Äôs mom find out about the affair?</h2><p>It‚Äôs revealed at the end of the episode that Denice has known all along. Apparently, Benjamin had a hard time keeping the secret from her. Denice even believes that the incident brought them closer together.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still healing, but right now he‚Äôs got a different type of healing to do,‚Äù she said as she encouraged Grace to go to his bedside.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2Bir8Rmm5qcXW5%2BcnnLqKWeZaOprrN5wqGcmqyZo7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
