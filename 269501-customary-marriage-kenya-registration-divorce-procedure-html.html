This change was a result of a gazetted notice Number 5345 dated 9th June 2017 put forward by the Attorney General, Githu Muigai. According to the gazetted announcement, all individuals married under the customary marriage act in Kenya must register their marriages from the 1st August 2017. Certificate of marriage can be obtained from any Huduma centre and given to the parties 21 days after registration. Registration of the union finalizes at the Registrar of Marriages based at Sheria House Ground Floor room 210.</p><p class=align-left>Due to the revised customary marriage laws implemented by the attorney general, married individuals have to pay certain fees to have their union registered with the state. The cost includes KSh 600 to notify the registrar of the marriage, then two thousand five hundred Kenyan shillings to record the union. Kenyans in the diaspora will part with a cool ten thousand Kenyan shillings to have their marriages registered at Kenyaâ€™s embassies while the search for marriage certificate will be KSh 500 up from KSh 200.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/895ff3cc4ab4844c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest means of submitting your CRB yearly return form for 2020/2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This move to register the customary marriage in Kenya seeks to solemnize the union of two parties in two ways, the cultural form as well as the legal way so that property can be shared accordingly in the event of dissolution of marriage. <a id=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/08/03/unregistered-customary-marriages-illegal-as-ag-order-takes-effect_c1609722 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Patrick Masiga</a>, a renowned marriage professional, explained that the new law was meant to safeguard children and women who are the most vulnerable victims following a broken marriage.</p><h2>Customary marriage divorce in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Dissolution of marriage in Kenya can be both judicial or extrajudicial. Also, before any spouses grants a divorce, elders must try to reconcile the two. However, if the reconciliation process proves futile, the elders have no choice but disband the marriage union. Some communities in Kenya are against divorce; hence, this is not an option at all such as Kuria and to some degree the Kisii community also.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3n47egmdg8j.jpeg><h3>Extra-judicial divorce</h3><p class=align-left>This kind of marriage dissolution become instigated by either the husband, the wife or by the wifeâ€™s kin. In case itâ€™s the man initiating it, he must send his wife away to her parentsâ€™ house and inform them of his intention to part ways with their daughter. If itâ€™s the wife instigating it, then she must voluntarily leave her matrimonial home and return to her parents. The case of the Wifeâ€™s parents initiating the divorce occurs when the husband fails to party the entire full bride price and they parents can go and take their daughter with them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6c2988e28295318b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to register a church in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The return of bride price under customary law signifies divorce; however, much depends on whether the two parties had any kids during their union. In this case, if the husband keeps the children, then no bride price is due, but if the wife decides to leave with the kids, her family must return part of the bride price that will depend on the total number of kids and their gender. Also, some communities where the woman remarries, the new husband must compensate the old one the bride price he had paid for her.</p><p class=align-left>For a marriage under customary law to undergo a successful divorce, then the elders must prove beyond any doubt that certain factors that are valid to warrant dissolution.
