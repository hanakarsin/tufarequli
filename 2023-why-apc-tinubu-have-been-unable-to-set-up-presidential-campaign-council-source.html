He was rooting for Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. All those ones are still there, that is why it is not easy for them to constitute the national campaign council.”</p><p>He added, “So unabated crisis, discordant tunes, selfishness and lack of internal democracy are specific factors militating or constituting the delay. In fact, some of those who call themselves the big guys are trying to hijack the process, hence the delay.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls Plateau State Governor, <strong>Simon Lalong</strong>, and the Minister of State for Labour, <strong>Festus Keyamo</strong>, have been named director general and spokesman respectively for the campaign council but other members of the team are yet to be unveiled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49uZmtoYmh6uLTYZpipm12ptq%2FBwa5koZmmmnqjscSnZK6mkZe5pnnTqGSsnaRiwrF5z6ucrKGUmru1tcClZJyZnaWuqrPNZpqorZ6Ytq150qisq5uVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
