Is it true that Eddie has been secretly cheating on his reality star wife? Keep reading for a breakdown of how the rumor came to be and how it has been addressed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">The rumors of Eddie Osefo cheating on Wendy stemmed from claims made by Gizelle Bryant.</h2><p>The beginning of Season 6 of the show saw Eddie and Wendy on seemingly solid ground, but it soon came into focus that the duo was questioning their happiness as a couple. On top of that, Gizelle decided to ask co-star Ashley Darby when they were finally "gonna talk about the Eddie rumors."</p><p>This moment set the tone for a heated beef between her and Wendy, who firmly told Gizelle that she wasn't going to let her “play with” her husband’s name on her watch.</p><p>The aforementioned "Eddie rumors" likely originated in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All About the Tea</a> report from May 2021 that suggested Eddie was being unfaithful to his wife. A source told the outlet that Eddie "has a side baby and is sleeping with a white woman who works in his law firm."</p><p>The attorney seemingly addressed these rumors in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post that same month, saying that they are completely unfounded.</p><p>Eddie indirectly mentioned the rumors by writing in the caption that Wendy is "the mother of my ONLY 3 babies." He also wrote, "The haters will always hate (misery loves company), but one thing is for certain, men lie, women lie, blogs lie, but numbers don’t! Ten years and counting with our forever love."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ever since these rumors came to light, Wendy and Eddie have seemingly been doing all they can to bolster the notion that their union is on solid ground. Besides loving Instagram posts, a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> spotlighted Wendy making it clear that she and Eddie wouldn't let the drama affect their marriage.</p><p>"People go and lie about you, and it is what it is. And I'm OK with that. I know what I signed up for," she explained, adding that Eddie is "not fazed" by it all.</p><p>Furthermore, the reality star slammed the blog that broke the rumors, calling them "salacious" and referencing how it "has also spread vicious rumors about [Gizelle] and her family" too.</p><p>She then redirected her grievances toward Gizelle for furthering the rumor, saying, "Talk about my wigs, my clothes, anything you want to, chile. Just talk about me, but don't talk about a man who is not just a good husband but a good father. And his only crime is supporting me to be on this platform."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dr. Wendy Osefo, PhD (@wendyosefo)</a></p></figure><p>Nonetheless, Gizelle stood firmly on her position regarding sharing the rumor. "Typically if things are out there, we talk about it," the castmate responded during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, adding, "In Potomac, we talk about it. We don't hide anything."</p><p>A preview for an upcoming episode of the show (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>) teases Wendy addressing Gizelle about her behavior, with the former firmly stating, "I'm putting you a-- on notice. Don't f--k with my family."</p><p>"Wendy! What the f--k?" Gizelle responds. The clip ends with Wendy telling her to "tread lightly."</p><p>Fans of the show will simply have to wait and see how much further this rumor is taken and how it continues to affect the dynamic between the two stars.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Potomac airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKvsNhmqaGnoGK1tr%2FBmqWdZZOdsqLAyKee</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
