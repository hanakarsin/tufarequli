Buhari from history has been sacrificing and is still sacrificing for the unity, security, prosperity, and for the emancipation of this country right from his days in the military and now as a civilian.</p><p>“The president’s interest is you and I. He is the only president that so far doesn’t have a foreign account, nor any house abroad, or companies anywhere rather than his Cattle. Even when he was on the sickbed, he wished Nigeria well.”</p><p>He added, “He fought the civil war to keep the country together. He didn’t fight from his office but from the war front, which means he was ready to sacrifice his life for the unity of the country. This is a president that has never been found wanting to have touched one naira of Nigeria’s money and has been known to always allow the will of the people to prevail. So the very least we, as his disciples and ardent followers, can do for him is to ensure that we do everything to support him to succeed.”</p><p>Bello also used the occasion to reiterate his interest in the 2023 presidency and the hope of succeeding President Buhari.</p><p>“When Mr. President succeeds, he is not succeeding for himself, his success is for Nigerians, whoever is wishing him to fail, is wishing Nigeria to fail. Very soon, I am going to answer the call of Nigerians to run for the presidency,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49tZputmJa%2FqnnHmqpmpp9is7C%2BxKKep2WRmLCwwc2tZKmqn6Wys8DYZqarZZikuqZ5wJupqJmUYryvuNhmn6KrXZiutcDLnmSymZiWxqJ5wZ6jpadf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
