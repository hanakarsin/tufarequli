The Presidency of Nigeria is not for characters like Bola Tinubu. Look at how he mismanaged the resources of Lagos State.</p><p>“It is surprising that he can even dream of becoming the President of Nigeria. He is living in cuckoo land.”</p><p>George said the APC chieftain would be surprised to see how things will go and how he will be double-crossed by those he is resting his back on to achieve his ambition.</p><p>He added that it would be an insult for the South-West, which is the most sophisticated region in the country, to settle for Tinubu.</p><p>George also said it was unfortunate that a hallowed ground like the Presidential Villa would be the location for Tinubu to declare his ambition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BpZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6%2Fzq6roWWnmsC1eceaqmappZa5qrLInptmpJWWsaa%2B0maroqall8Juus6tZKimlWK8p3nToZymZZKksaZ5xp6mq5%2BVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
