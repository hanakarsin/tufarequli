When is her due date?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@witneycarson</a></figure><p>We've been following <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> pro Witney Carson since she was a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance a whole decade ago. We've grown up with her, watched her career progress on DWTS, watched her get married, and watched her have a beautiful son.</p><p>Now, in her 13th season on Dancing With the Stars, Witney has once again made it to the <a href=#>semifinals</a>. And this time it came with an exciting yet unexpected announcement: She and <a href=#>her husband, Carson McAllister</a>, are pregnant with their second child!</p><p>After Witney and her partner, Wayne Brady, took the stage, Witney revealed the happy news during their interview. “I’m so excited to finally announce that Carson, [son] Leo, and myself are expecting baby number two. So, I’m so blessed, and this just felt like a really, really good time to share it,” Witney exclaimed.</p><p>So, when is Witney's baby due? Let's find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is Witney Carson's due date?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@witneycarson</a><p>Witney Carson and her husband, Carson McAllister</p></figure><p>While Witney has yet to speak about when the baby is due, she's definitely not showing yet. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthline</a>, women can start showing anywhere between 12 and 16 weeks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heathline</a> also report that a lot of women wait until after the first trimester, so right after 12 weeks, to start announcing their pregnancy.</p><p>With these two factors in mind, Witney is probably between the 12 and 16-week mark and felt that it was time to let the fans know since her belly may pop out any day now! This would mean that baby Carson-McAllister is due mid-May to mid-June 2023. More importantly, it's looking like this baby will be a Gemini. They may get a bad rep for being two-faced, but they sure are a lot of fun!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Witney and Carson already has a son named Leo!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Witney Carson McAllister (@witneycarson)</a></p></figure><p>OK, Leo is adorable and may actually be Witney's twin. Leo was born on Jan. 3, 2021. In honor of his birth, Witney posted an adorable photo of him wrapped in a blanket.</p><p>"Kevin Leo McAllister. Named after his grandpa who sent him down to us," she captioned the pic. "Born on Jan. 3, 2021. 7lbs. 2oz. 21 inches long! My little Leo, I love you more than words can express.

"Then I realized that without my C-section, Leo wouldn’t be here and maybe neither of us would be. I’m so thankful that C-sections are possible!!! My C-section gave me a new found strength mentally and physically, a beautiful battle scar, and my most precious gift."</p><p>Thank you for bringing awareness, Witney!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Witney and her husband, Carson, grew up together!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Witney Carson McAllister (@witneycarson)</a></p></figure><p>Witney and <a href=#>Carson</a> grew up together in Utah and are even high school sweethearts.
