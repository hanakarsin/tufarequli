So, this registration exercise first brings about all family members in all wards and polling stations of the country together.”</p><p>“So, it means coming back together, but more importantly, it is also a period for evangelism, expansion of the party database.</p><p>“You will see, in the past, we have had some unfortunate incidents where perhaps some people were appointed, only for us to find out that they are deceased. So, this is also an opportunity to clean up because there are opportunities also as a member of a party that forms a government.</p><p>“And we need to know who is where; we also need to know what party members do. So, if I am a party member and want to host an event, I can look in my party’s database and see who does event planning, who does catering, and we share prosperity,” NAN quoted him as saying.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> has been asked by the South-West chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>stop shedding crocodile tears following the death of former Governor of Lagos State, Lateef Jakande</a></strong>.</p><p>Buhari and the All Progressives Congress paid tribute to Jakande who was buried on Friday at the age of 91.</p><p>The opposition party in its reaction called on Buhari and the ruling party not to cry more than the bereaved.</p><p>The party in a statement titled, ‘S’West PDP mourns Jakande’s death, tells Buhari not to shed crocodile tears’, said Buhari destroyed some of the legacies of the respected elder statesman when he was military head of state between December 31, 1983, and August 27, 1985.</p><p>The statement was signed by the party’s Director Media and Publicity in the region, <strong>Lere Olayinka</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5BsZqGnp2Kusa%2BMq5yvmZyesaLAyKilZp2omr%2BktdKeZLChnKF6tMDOqWSbrZiWv6p5xaumpmWRpb2wtc2toKefXZmyorCMqZyoqJyaeqet0qGmpZlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
