Instead, it's referring to events that took place at the end of Manifest Season 3. In Season 3, Episode 13, "Mayday, Part 2," Eagan was one of the passengers who believed Ben and Michaela Stone were working for the NSA.</p><p>Eagan's anger led him to the home of NSA Director Robert Vance, where he and another passenger took Vance's 15-year-old son hostage. In that episode, Eagan and his co-conspirator were arrested for their actions.</p><p>While his trip through the criminal justice system wasn't shown on screen, Season 4 picks up with him having been sentenced and now serving time for that situation. But that's not the end of Eagan's story.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Eagan get out of prison in 'Manifest'?</h2><p>In Season 4, Episode 4, "Go-Around," Ben's continued <a href=#>search for his daughter, Eden,</a> leads him to Eagan. He visits Eagan in prison to discover that Eagan has been attacked while in custody — he sports several bruises and a black eye.

The U.S. government offers to suspend Eagan's sentence and immediately release him — if his information leads to Eden being safely reunited with Ben.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Hearing how the hostage situation traumatized Vance's family and ruined his marriage makes Ben literally take the deal off the table. However, some cajoling from Eagan changes his mind, as the other man points out that Ben has a chance to put his own family back together.</p><p>Eagan signs the government's plea agreement and gives Ben a piece of paper that will allegedly lead him to Eden. The paper promptly disintegrates in Ben's hand within moments of him reading it.</p><p>While it's exactly the lead Ben has spent four episodes desperate for, it's not such a happy moment for Vance, who knows that the man who destroyed his life gets to walk free.</p><p>Season 4 of Manifest is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ6Zl5a7brXNZqeroaOku265wKegn52jqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
