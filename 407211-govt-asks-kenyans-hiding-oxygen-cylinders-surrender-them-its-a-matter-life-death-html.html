These cylinders are expensive and the international market is currently squeezed," he said.<p class=align-left>CS Kagwe added it was unlawful for one to hold the cylinders while the government had asked that they be returned back.</p>"Supply is a problem. Each cylinder costs about Ksh.40,000. To replace them would require a lot of money. It is an offence to keep the cylinders when we have asked for them under the Public Health Act,” said Kagwe.<p class=align-left>With the current demand for Oxygen, Kagwe said the government could not bank on the local manufactures due to their factories being faulty and in disrepair. The CS said the factories needed urgent servicing before they could resume operations.</p>“We have around 70 oxygen plants in Kenya. Most of these plants are in disrepair and we need to get them working very urgently. We are going to standardise the kind of oxygen plants that we have in the country because as we speak we can’t get spare parts for some of the plants that were built years essentially because they came from sources that are suspect,"<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8185e64235dae82d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mombasa County Icu Beds Empty as Other Counties Grapple with Shortage Amid Third COVID-19 Wave</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The CS stated that unless the local infrastructures necessary for Oxygen production are renovated to meet the over par standards, the government was not going to rely on the local plants.</p>“We need to increase the infrastructure for piping in hospitals. What is now happening is that individual cylinders are being used per patient such that we have a cylinder lying next to a patient. This is inefficient and dangerous," he added."Therefore we are asking facilties in the country to expedite the piping of oxygen. And then course these are pressurised cylinders and so anything can happen when we have something like that placed next to a patient,” said Kagwe.<p class=align-left>This follows concerns raised by Health CAS Rashid Aman who claimed some <a href=#>facilities were hoarding gas cylinders</a> thus hindering refilling and redistribution.</p><p class=align-left>The health ministry has been asking the health facilities in the country to ensure that they put to good use the available cylinders for oxygen storage and distribution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3bc04c2c40726f7c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gov't Puts on Spot Private Hospitals Demanding Huge Sums of Money Before Admitting Patients to ICUs</span></p></a>"They must be availed to the manufacturers to ensure a steady supply line of the commodity, empty idle cylinders in one location can mean loss of life in another location," Aman had cautioned.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
