To do so, he invited over a group of boys to play a game near the abandoned estate.&nbsp;</p><p>The game took a wrong turn in no time.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, Steve decided to climb up a defunct train carriage. Unable to gauge the distance correctly, the young boy tripped, fell down on the concrete, and died shortly afterward.&nbsp;</p><p>The tragic accident inspired Shaun to become a doctor — so that he could help anybody who finds himself in a similar situation. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The mid-season finale of The Good Doctor brought Steve back to the fore.</h2><p>The episode showed us a family gathering unlike the standard scenes of Thanksgiving-themed movies and TV series.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of smiley faces, laughing relatives and kids roaming around the house relentlessly, "Friends and Family" plunged us into a tension-filled, ice-cold family dinner filled with awkward silences.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Soon after his arrival to the family home, Shaun made the mistake of prompting his father to take responsibility for his brother's death. Overcome with rage, Edward responded with some unwarranted, deeply insensitive commentary, accusing Shaun of having killed his brother. The event escalates, the festive spirits fade into thin air, Shaun retreats to his old room and eventually finds solace in Lea's (!!!) arms.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Lea on The Good Doctor and should we expect her to get to know Shaun even closer?&nbsp;</h2><p>As the devoted fans of the show probably spotted, Carly (Jasika Nicole) was absent from the family proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p>As David Shore, The Good Doctor EP explained in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a>, this isn't an accident.&nbsp;</p><p>The creators were eager to explore how Shaun responds to a relationship that's anything like the one he had with Carly.&nbsp;</p><p>"We see Shaun in a very vulnerable moment, a very different moment, and in a very non-sexual situation, but we see him achieve a level of physical intimacy with Lea that he wasn’t able to achieve with Carly, so as we go forward, we explore the significance of that," David told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnSoZiupqNir7O706Gcq2WXpLylecOomq2nog%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
