Moi was never seen in public with his late wife, for instance, and the two would later be separated. Some of his children have been through similar challenges with their spouses in divorces that dragged them to court. The Moi family is a large one comprising not only his children but also siblings and other close relatives.</p><h2>Wife: Lena Moi</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/58bb89d101c509e6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>David Sankok, 6 Other Kenyan Politicians Who Have Lost Their Children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kenyans know the wives of all Kenyan presidents from their public appearances as first ladies, except for Daniel arap Moi wife, Lena Moi. Lena, born Helena Bomett, came from the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Paul Bomett family</a>, who were pioneer Christians in Eldama Ravine. Lena’s parents respected a young, tall, handsome, and well-mannered Daniel Moi, who was an orphan from a young age.</p><p class=align-left>Moi would stay with Lena’s family during the school holidays because his home was far away. When both Moi and Lena became teachers, they started dating and eventually got married. Moi paid two heifers, an ox and four sheep as bride price before their wedding took place at the AIC mission in Eldama Ravine.</p><p class=align-left>As Moi left teaching for politics, his relationship with Lena started having problems as well. Moi and Lena separated in 1974 and got divorced in 1979, having been married for 24 years. So, when did Lena Moi die? Lena passed away in 2004, having lived alone since 1979 and was buried in Moi’s Kabarak home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6aaebeb44882f06d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mwai: Meet Jimmy Kibaki's Beautiful Family, from Rumoured Wives, Children</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/58bb89d101c509e6.jpeg><h2>Daniel and Lena Moi’s children</h2><p class=align-left>Daniel arap Moi and Lena had a considerably big family with eight children, namely Jennifer, Jonathan, Raymond, Philip, John Mark, Doris, June and Gideon.</p><h3>Jenniffer Chemutai Kositany</h3><p class=align-left>She is one of the three daughters of president Moi. She was born in 1953 and is the eldest in the Daniel Arap Moi family. She attended Kenya High School and then proceeded for university education in the United States. Much like most of her siblings, she maintains a private life. Her husband, the late Stephen Kositany, died in a road accident, leaving Jenniffer a widow.</p><h3>Jonathan Toroitich</h3><p class=align-left>Jonathan was the second born and the eldest of the Daniel Arap Moi sons. Jonathan was 20 years old when his parents separated, and while other siblings went to live with Mr. Moi, he chose to remain with his mother. It angered president Moi, and the two were never close ever since. Jonathan passed on in April 2019 after a long battle with cancer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8601c7c1939bc9ee.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Timothy Madden: Gabbi Doolin murder sentence and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>John MarkThe third of Moi’s children is named John Mark. John happens to be the least known of all Moi’s children. He was born in 1958 and later went abroad for studies but came back before completing his education.</p><h3>Raymond Moi</h3><p class=align-left>The current MP for Rongai comes fourth in the lineup of Moi children. He was born in 1960 and has proceeded to make a name for himself in politics, although not to the extent his father did.</p><h3>Philip and Doris</h3><p class=align-left>After Raymond, President Moi, and Lena had twins named Philip and Doris. Philip joined the army and served until the time of his retirement. He then ventured into polo as a sport and was among the first Kenyans to do so. He divorced his wife Rosana Pluda and was dragged to court for a Ksh. 90 million maintenance case.</p><p class=align-left>His twin Doris has kept her distance from the public eye. She went to Nairobi Primary, Limuru Girls, and later the British-curriculum based Imani School found in Thika. She then went to Australia, where she stayed for a while. She serves as a board member in some of the schools associated with her father. Like her eldest sister, Doris is also a widow after her husband Simon died in a road crash.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/859e9f09fad580c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Attributes His Improved Life to Birth of Visually Impaired Twins: "I Was Pushed to Work Hard"</span></p></a><h3>Gideon Moi</h3><p class=align-left>The youngest son of president Moi happens to be the most popular and successful among all of Moi’s children. He was also Moi’s favorite son, which is why he has been the family spokesperson. Gideon is also the most accomplished when it comes to a political career. He heads KANU, the political party with which his father ruled the country and is the current senator for Baringo county.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6aaebeb44882f06d.jpeg><h3>June</h3><p class=align-left>June happens to be the youngest and adopted daughter of Daniel Moi. June is also Moi’s favorite alongside Gideon Moi. She attended Moi Primary before moving to Kenya High School and then a university in Canada. Instead of politics, she chose business and has been quite successful at it.</p><h2>Daniel Arap Moi siblings</h2><p class=align-left>Daniel Arap Moi’s father was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Kimoi arap Chebii</a>, but he died when Moi was only four years old. Moi was the fifth child of Kabon, who was Chebii’s senior wife. There is not a lot of information about Daniel Arap Moi parents and siblings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7067527ddde1e676.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife?

William is said to have played a pivotal role in shaping Daniel Moi after the death of their father. William died in 1995, but not before his brother had converted him into Christianity.</p><p class=align-left>The death of Daniel Arap Moi marked the end of an era for the entire Kenyan nation. He might have retired from power almost two decades ago, but he remained an influential figure as far as Kenyan politics is concerned. His torch might have dimmed, but his children led by Gideon Moi, have made sure that the name Moi lives on in the politics of the country. The Moi family has shown a united front and might be looking to have one of their own have a shot at the presidency soon.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>List of top 7 leaders who have declared interest in 2022 presidential race</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkXFrbmtdma6vtcSlZJqqkaV6rrvIZp2apZmhxm7DyJ%2BcZqOZmcBuv8ibo6Kml6h7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
