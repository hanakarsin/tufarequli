This is unraveling before our very eyes even before the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) blows the whistle for electioneering campaign. His party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is in disarray. The signs are just too ominous for the Waziri what with the report by the Economic Intelligence Unit predicting another trashing for him in the forthcoming polls.”</p><p>Onanuga berated Atiku for refusing to honour the zoning principle, adding that he is now faced with karma.</p><p>He stated that the war in the party which is the effect of a fight to finish battle from the faction of Wike has killed any momentum Atiku has built ahead of the election.</p><p>He argued that members within the party have already lost confidence in the PDP which he said is already on the brink of disappearing from the political scene.</p><p>“A pillar of Atiku’s campaign is the claim of being a unifier and nationalist. That bogus claim has now been discredited, even within his party as the disaffected members cry for justice and inclusivity.</p><p>“Instead of the perennially running and perennially failing candidate to offer them some sop, he has rebuffed them, pleading that he could not grant their request for justice.</p><p>“Surely a man who cannot resolve a genuine dispute among his party members, who cannot forge an entente among them, cannot be expected to unify our country. Instead of being a unifier, Atiku is now a divider-in-chief, he added.</p><p>The APC stalwart condemned the PDP flagbearer’s campaign program, insisting that all he was proposing has already being implemented by the APC.</p><p>Speaking further, Onanuga stated that Atiku brought the crisis upon himself by pushing the narrative that only northern candidate can win the presidency for his party, despite the open record that southerners, when they network with their northern compatriots can also win the election.</p><p>In conclusion, he wrote, “Former leaders, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and Dr. Goodluck Jonathan demonstrated this in 1999, 2003 and 2011.</p><p>“As a campaign, we can only pity former Vice President Atiku for the self-inflicted injury he invited unto himself. Chinua Achebe, the very accomplished novelist in one of his classics, Arrow of God, wrote that a man who brought ant-infested faggots into the homestead should not grumble when lizards begin to pay him a visit.</p><p>“Atiku brought this unto himself and we dare say he can kiss his ill-fated presidential bid goodbye.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FsZpuqlZa4qrrGZpitoZuqeqStzWaioqujYrWqv4yio6VllpbBprCMqameq5mZsq%2FAyJqjZpqZmXqou86dmbKdXZa9pHnRnpicrKNiwbB5z52nZpuinsCqv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
