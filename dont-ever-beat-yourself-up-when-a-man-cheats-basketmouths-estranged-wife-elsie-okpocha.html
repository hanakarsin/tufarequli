Naija News reports that Elsie made this known in a post via Instagram, stating that cheating has nothing to do with a woman.

You’ll be beautiful,you will know how to make all his favorite dishes, you will be sexy as hell,and be intelligent and smart and he will still cheat.</p><p>“So it’s not you, it is never you.Don’t go cry in your room, or starving yourself or being sad. Stop all that nonsense,don’t go and blame yourself for something someone else has decided to do, DONT!</p><p>“Don’t blame yourself for something someone else decides to do. But i am not here tell you what to do, if at the point, you decided on what you wanna do, make sure your happiness comes first.</p><p>“And like I always say, marry a kind man, cos when you do, if and when he decides to cheat unfortunately, he knows to consider you on the sense that while he’s doing his shit, he will never let you find out, because he knows it will hurt you, he will never disrespect you, he will never put you in a situation where you are constantly humiliated or embarrassed. So again to you women, remember it’s not you, infact, it’s always never you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49vZp2nnql6psLEq2SbnZGperq71KuqnqSWYsKxedahnKdlkWK6orqMnJ%2BemaSoeqOt0qScraWfqsGpv4yeqq2qkaO0prCMsKCfnV2aubS1xGampKifmLWiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
