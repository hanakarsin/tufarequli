J.K. Rowling has made numerous public anti-trans comments, and while she was not directly involved in the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, she is still likely to profit from the title.
Like every big video game released within the past few years, Hogwarts Legacy isn’t without its fair share of glitches."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Originally, no one knew exactly why characters were blue in Hogwarts Legacy, but some eagle-eyed fans have noticed that it’s likely related to an errant accessibility setting.</p><p>Intended as a setting to help players with visual impairments, the "High Contrast Gameplay" setting is likely to blame for the blue hue. This setting imparts a strong blue pigment to your entire character, making it easy to discern them from the rest of your environment. It’s a helpful feature for those who need it, but it seems that the setting has a penchant for randomly becoming enabled.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to fix blue characters in 'Hogwarts Legacy'.</h2><p>Thankfully, fixing the blue character bug in Hogwarts Legacy takes just a few seconds. All you need to do is turn off the "High Contrast Gameplay" setting. This can be found by pausing the game and diving into the "Settings" menu. From here, navigate to the "Accessibility Options" menu, then scroll until you find the "High Contrast Gameplay" setting and toggle it to "Off."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This will most likely fix the issue, although if you’re still running around looking like a member of the Blue Man Group, consider reaching out directly to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WB Games Support</a>.
