It's all gone."</p><p>She added, "I know it is very materialistic, and [I] should be happy with what I was left/have.

"It depends on a lot of things like taxes and VISAs," he said during a live stream. "Under EU law, I have to be in the U.K. for a certain amount of days or I’ll be taxed in another country."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">PewDiePie has been getting ripped while in quarantine.</h2><p>On Sept. 30, the gamer showed of his incredibly toned physique in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shirtless pic</a> on Instagram. The steamy image confirmed that PewDiePie’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">workout routine</a>, which he shared with fans in May, is certainly working for him.</p><p>"So on Mondays, I do push exercises. I do heavily on chest and I finish off with shoulders," he explained in a video that currently has more than nine million views. "Tuesdays, I do legs, squats, dead-lifts, lunges. Wednesday, I do pull exercises. Thursday, I do leg again. And Friday, I finish with a mix of push and pull."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The internet personality also changed up his diet. "Probably the biggest difference for me was cutting out alcohol," he stated. "I decided to cut off hard liquor from my palette. I just realized it’s not for me. If other people like it, that’s great, I’m just not doing it."</p><p>However, PewDiePie did clarify that he does drink "a pint of beer once a week" when he’s with friends. "Looking back on my old drinking habits, I really look back on it with detest and shame of my past self," he confessed.&nbsp;</p><p>"You have to realize that sensational pleasures don’t bring happiness. And as soon as you take that first [sip], it’s already fleeting.
