The couple is extremely private — they keep their relationship out of the spotlight, rarely sharing photos of each other on social media other than a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cute Snapchat photo</a> of the lovers sipping wine during the early days of their romance.</p><p>However, the pair offered fans a glimpse into their life when they made their long-awaited public debut at the singer-songwriter's Horan & Rose Gala in September 2021. Niall and Amelia posed for photos together at the event, and many fans (including us) still fangirl over how beautiful and in love they look with each other.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Niall Horan talking about his current relationship with Amelia <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IV64jJZK9B</a></p>— Niall Horan Daily Media (@NHDNMedia) <a href=#>February 22, 2023</a></figure><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>, Amelia studied fashion business at Istituto Marangoni.

He also didn't hold back from admitting his flaws, claiming he's a "bad communicator."</p><p>"I'm a bad communicator in relationships. I struggle to talk about things," the "Put a Little Love on Me" singer said. "I don't like to let things build up in me and songwriting does help get it out but it can happen too late."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>He added, "With any relationship, there are fun moments and there are days when you feel like you're in a music video with the rains pouring outside as you watch crying through the window."
