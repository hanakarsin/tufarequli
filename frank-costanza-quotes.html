"Serenity now!"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>You can totally hear this photo, right? Frank's beloved "rage controlling exercise" will always be ringing in our ears, whether we're arguing with our S.O.s or simply getting into it with family on Festivus. And whether you're yelling it or repeating it in a (probably recommended) relaxed manner is entirely up to you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. "A brassiere for men... the manssiere! Get it?"</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Frank's entrepreneurial skills were — well — truly something else. The "bro" or "manssiere," which he co-created with Kramer, may have been destined for failure, but it was definitely innovative in its own special way.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. "No breaks. I feel reborn. I'm like a phoenix rising from Arizona!"</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>His dedication to the bro — or the manssierre — was unmatched. He was an inspiration to us all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. "No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think I've got a foot odor problem."</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Foot odor was the root of Frank's failed relationship during the Korean war — before acting as Elaine's "spy" to tell her if her manicurist was gossiping about her, Frank recounts the story of falling in love with a Korean woman, which ended with a bad breakup because he refused to take off his shoes in her home. Luckily, they were able to rekindle their love several years later at the end of the episode, but it didn't take long for them to start arguing again.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. "The tradition of festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I've got a lot of problems with you people, and now, you're gonna hear about it!"</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>As the founder of Festivus, Frank guides his friends and family through the annual Dec. 23 tradition, and since it all starts with the "airing of grievances," we know Frank won't be holding back.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. "You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*."</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>When Estelle's "bettering herself," Frank informs her he's been pumping iron... we're so proud.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. “You saying you want a piece of me?”</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><p>When George gets arrested, Frank steps in to fight for his son's honor... and obviously, Elaine is ready to dish tremendous sass.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. "They don't want us there, so we're going."</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Frank and Estelle are no stranger to doing things out of spite, which includes moving to the same Florida community as the Seinfelds... a totally classic Constanza move.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. "You have no eye for fashion!"</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><p>When Frank is spotted with his lawyer, who wears a cape, George and his mom, Estelle, ask him about it... and Frank is ready to defend him at all costs.</p><p>Frank Costanza was a beloved character in the realm of Seinfeld, so needless to say, Jerry Stiller will be greatly missed.
