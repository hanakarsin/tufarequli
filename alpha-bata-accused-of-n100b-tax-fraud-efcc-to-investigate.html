The former MD believes there is a lot of corruption in the country and decided to blow the whistle in line with the anti-corruption policy of the government.</p><p>“When they call us, we will provide more documents and other information.” he said.</p><p>Apara admonished the EFCC to work on the petition, adding that a simple investigation will reveal the fraud perpetrated by the company.</p><p>When the phone numbers on the website of the company was called by Punch’s correspondents for comment, the lady who answered the call said she had nothing to say about the report.</p><p>The staff, who didn’t reveal her name, said, “There is nothing I can say about it (the petition). I’m also seeing it (the petition) the way you saw it.”</p><p>Also, officials of Lagos State Government declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>The Spokesman for the EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, said this in a message sent to our correspondent.</p><p>He said, “If the petition has been submitted to the commission as claimed, it will be processed like all other petitions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWloZH16e49xZpqkoJ2ubq7ArZhmmZOYwrSxw2amn2WeZn1xroytmLFllqeutrCMnp2cm12pvG61za%2BcrKyZnK61sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
