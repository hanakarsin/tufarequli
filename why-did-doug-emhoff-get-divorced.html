But why did Doug and Kerstin get divorced? The lawyer recently took the blame for the end of his first marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kemhoff</a><p>Cole, Kerstin, Doug, and Ella Emhoff and friends at Doug and Kamala's home</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Doug admits to having an affair on Kerstin, leading to their divorce in 2008.</h2><p>In a 2016 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a> profile about Doug, it was revealed that he and Kerstin, now the co-founder and CEO of Prettybird production company, got married in 1992. They divorced after 16 years of marriage, and the reason behind their divorce hasn't been made public until August 2024, when Doug broke his silence admit tabloid reports he cheated.</p><p>"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side, Doug said in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>.</p><p>Doug seemingly admitted to reports he had an affair with his then-young daughter’s teachers. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail,</a> the woman became pregnant but decided not to keep the baby. The relationship ended years before Doug began dating Kamala.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kerstin Emhoff (@kemhoff)</a></p></figure><p>Doug's ex-wife also released a statement, saying, "Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago. He is a great father to our kids, continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kamala Harris previously called the blended family "almost too functional."</h2><p>Kamala has often said that their blended family is “almost too functional” as she and Kerstin have become friends over the years of co-parenting Ella and Cole.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a><p>Kamala and Doug at stepson Cole's graduation in 2017 with Kerstin Emhoff.</p></figure><p>“When [Doug and Kamala] first started dating and [Kamala] was [attorney general of California], I just thought, ‘Wow, that’s cool. Don’t mess this up!’” Kerstin told Marie Claire. Once Kamala went on the campaign trail as Biden’s running mate, Kerstin stepped up to volunteer for the campaign, shocking staffers and media pundits alike.</p><p>"We really hit it off ourselves and became friends,” Kamala wrote in her 2019 memoir, The Truths We Hold. In fact, the three of them even attended spin classes together.</p><p>“When she was [California attorney general] and senator, I’d meet them at the SoulCycle by their house, and we’d take a class together,” Kerstin told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a>. “There’s just no chance of doing that now … We’ve talked about that but I think it would torture Secret Service.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kamala Harris (@kamalaharris)</a></p></figure><p>In fact, when <a href=#>J.D. Vance</a> tried to insult Kamala by calling her a “<a href=#>childless cat lady,</a>” Kerstin had one of the fiercest defenses. “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Kerstin Emhoff shared in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>. "She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it."</p><p>While Kerstin tries to keep her love life private, she coyly hinted at her own budding romance in 2021. “Maybe,” Kerstin told Politico when asked if she had a special someone. “I don’t need any people that are in my personal life getting any spotlight. It’s already complicated enough.”</p><p>Kerstin may be close to the spotlight because of her association with Kamala and Doug, but it seems like she’s doing just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2acn6q0brHMoaafnl2csrV5w6KtqKqTmrE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
