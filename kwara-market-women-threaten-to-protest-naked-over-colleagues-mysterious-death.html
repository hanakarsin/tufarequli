However, the market union’s leadership swiftly intervened, calling for an emergency meeting to calm the frayed nerves.</p><p>According to the deceased’s son, Mariam, on Friday, January 12th, 2024, had escorted two individuals in plain clothes who purported to be policemen to apprehend him at his mother’s shop. This followed a similar incident involving his younger brother, Latif, the previous day (Thursday).</p><p>“On getting to the police headquarters, Ilorin, I was detained at the cell from that Friday (12th January) till Monday 15th January, the day my mother died.</p><p>“It was when the news of the death of my mother broke out on Monday 15th January, and she was about to be buried, that they released me to attend her janaza“, he said.</p><p>He mentioned that his mother had been buried in accordance with Islamic rites at her residence in Agbooba, Ilorin, opposite Koken Nursery and Primary School.</p><p>While it remains uncertain whether the substance allegedly poured on her contributed to Medinat’s death, a matter stirring controversy among marketers, the reopening of the disputed shops on Monday, January 29th, by the authorities of Ilorin West Local Government, and the resumption of Mariam without acknowledging her co-trader’s passing, have ignited tensions in the market.</p><p>Following the crisis, the local government reportedly closed the two shops. However, Mariam allegedly sought legal recourse and obtained a court order compelling the local government to reopen the market.</p><p>Incensed by this turn of events, the leadership of the market union, represented by the Baboko Marketers’ Association, has issued a threat to protest nude if the authorities of Ilorin West Local Government do not intervene and restrain Mariam.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5JpZqSvkaeubrnAq6KerF2svK6xzWaroaqVlsGmuoytpmaooqTBpr%2FTZqWao5WZerDCxKtknKecobKis9SeqmalqajBpr7IqKysZZSarrW0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
