He noted that there is more competition when it comes to dating women in Nigeria hence his reason for preferring women abroad.
The actor made the revelation in a recent interview on Menisms Podcast.
Egbuson argued that being with Nigerian women abroad gives you better dating experience.
He said, “This is me talking from my personal experience, honestly I feel like you would get a better dating experience from a Nigerian girl living abroad than those living here."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’ve never had a time off or fall off for 15 years consistently.</p><p>“I believe that I genuinely opened up the way for a lot of new school young actors. I also believe that I opened up the leading male young actor category.</p><p>“And I said that very humbly because when I joined Nollywood, there were no lead roles for young men. You either had to be an old man or a lady. All the young men that were acting were playing minor roles. Nobody was actively writing lead roles for young men.</p><p>If you put everything that I’ve accomplished together, I believe that I am the biggest actor in Africa.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BuZqJloKeyp7HRZpuarJmjtG66yKCcq6GRo3qotdGlqmaZkqe8orCMq5itoJWnerW0wKdkraCVYryvsdJmmK1lmKS6pnnToqSipplisqiu1Kymp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
