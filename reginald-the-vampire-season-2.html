However, its newest series, Reginald the Vampire, has its own cult following of fans who are obsessed with its new take on the classic vampire stereotypes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here's what we know about the future of the popular show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: SYFY</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has ‘Reginald the Vampire’ been renewed for Season 2?</h2><p>As of December 2022, there hasn’t been any news on a renewal or cancellation when it comes to Reginald the Vampire. While its story is far from over, the possibility of a Season 2 always depends on a series’ ratings. Reginald the Vampire premiered to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">audience of over .294 million viewers</a>, but its viewership dropped to .166 million viewers by Episode 3. However, that audience has remained relatively steady since.</p><p>In comparison, it’s the lowest-viewed show of any SYFY series, right behind <a href=#>Chucky’s second season</a>. However, its 18–49 demographic viewership is slightly higher than that of Astrid & Lilly Save the World, which also has yet to be renewed or canceled. Although these numbers don’t look too good for Reginald the Vampire, SyFy doesn’t have many original series to work with.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: SYFY</span></figure><p>A potential Season 2 for Reginald the Vampire really just depends on how the network fe as far as packing their schedule out. They were super high on bringing the show to viewers to begin with, and perhaps an uptick in viewers for further episodes could bring Reginald back (for another season, but not to his human form sadly). Plus, ratings don’t tend to take streaming into account, so if SYFY incorporates its streaming numbers, there could be a much larger number of viewers than we’re aware of.</p><p>If that’s the case, then the best we can do is cross our fingers and hope that Reginald the Vampire will pick up where it left off for a second season.</p><p>Reginald the Vampire airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on SYFY.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7Kotc2ao51lpJ2ybsLApqeiqpViwKat0qilZmo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
