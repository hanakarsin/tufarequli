From television to movies to cartoons, Seth’s resume is overflowing with comedic roles and niche characters that we know and love (Kenny from Can’t Hardly Wait, anyone?)</p><p>Back in the day, Seth was a staple when it came to funny and popular entertainment, but now that we’re in 2020, we can’t help but wonder: what happened to Seth Green? And where is he now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Seth has been acting since the ‘80s.</h2><p>Seth began working as a child actor back in the ‘80s, working on TV shows like The Facts of Life and movies like Can’t Buy Me Love. His career took off in the early ‘90s when he played beloved Oz on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Scott Evil, Dr. Evil’s moody teenage son, in the Austin Powers movies.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he may be best known for voicing Chris Griffin on the popular animated series, Family Guy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While some may not see Seth as an A-list actor, he has acted next to big names like Rob Lowe, Ashton Kutcher, and Mike Myers. Seth's ability to play off of these more serious actors and let his comedic talents shine was one of the reasons so many found Seth to be appealing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Back in the ‘90s and early 2000s</a>, it seemed like you couldn’t see a film or watch a show without Seth making an appearance. So where has he been these days?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what is Seth Green up to now?</h2><p>Seth formed his production company and animation studio, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stoopid Buddy Stoodios</u></a>, formerly Stoopid Monkey, with a handful of friends back in 2005. Since then, they have produced one of Adult Swim’s most popular animated television series, Robot Chicken.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>While the name may seem strange, Robot Chicken is nothing to squawk at. The series has won five Primetime Emmy Awards, including 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2018 Emmys for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program. Seth created the series by combining his love of action figures, stop-motion style animation, and stellar vocal performances from pop culture icons.</p><p>Robot Chicken just premiered its tenth season in September 2019, and Seth recently announced that his team will be bringing their stop-animation show to Fox. The network <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered a holiday special </a>from Seth Green’s Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, which will air next winter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Fox has a long and valued history with Seth as an actor, due largely to his fantastic voice work as ‘Chris Griffin’ on ‘Family Guy.’ But Seth and his partners at Stoopid Buddy have created best-in-class stop-motion animation as well, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to grow this relationship,” said Michael Thorn, President, Entertainment, Fox Entertainment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Seth's also part of yet-to-be-seen 'Star Wars' TV series.</h2><p>Back in 2012, there were rumors that a new Star Wars series was going to come to fruition and Seth was involved not only because he is known for his notable voice overs but because he is also a huge Star Wars fan. (He even had his wedding at Skywalker Ranch!)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Star Wars: Detours is an animated comedy set in the Star Wars universe where Seth voices the classic character, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The series was put on hold for many years while LucasFilm was sold to Disney and <a href=#>many other blockbuster Star Wars films were released</a>. Despite having 39 episodes finished, Lucasfilm announced on March 11, 2013, that Detours has been delayed indefinitely.</p><p>The explanation was the company does not want children being introduced to the characters as comic portrayals before Star Wars: Episode VII —The Force Awakens (2015) was released. However, according to IMDB and the introduction of Disney+, there have been rumors that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Detours</u><u> may come to the platform soon.</u></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Seth wrote and directed a film released in 2019</h2><p>Seth makes his directorial debut with the comedy-drama Changeland. Seth also wrote the film, which follows a troubled man as he goes through a personal crisis. He meets up with his estranged friend, played by Breckin Meyer, in Thailand.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Take a holiday with your best friend!
