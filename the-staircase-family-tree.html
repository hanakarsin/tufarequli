Together, they had two children named Clayton and Todd. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar,</a> they lived in Germany for several years before moving back to the U.S. Even though Patricia is Michael’s ex-wife, she was supportive of his innocence from the very beginning of the trial.</p><p>Michael also adopted two daughters named Margaret and Martha after their mother, Elizabeth Ratliff, passed away. Elizabeth was one of his close friends. After divorcing Patricia, Michael remarried Kathleen and their marriage lasted for nearly 30 years until her untimely death.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about all the kids involved?</h2><p>Kathleen shared a daughter with a man named Fred Atwater before she met Michael. Her daughter is named Caitlyn Atwater. At first, Caitlyn believed Michael was innocent. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, she told the media about the loving relationship she saw between Michael and her mother.</p><p>She later changed her mind and became convinced that Michael was definitely guilty of killing Kathleen. Caitlyn went as far as to sue Michael for $25 million in damages in a wrongful death lawsuit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As it stands today, it’s highly unlikely Caitlyn will be able to collect any significant amount of money from Michael regardless of her attempt to come after him.</p><p>Clayton, one of Michael and Patricia's sons, believes Michael is innocent.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, she’s currently living in Colorado.</p><p>All the kids involved in Michael’s life, aside from Caitlyn, are on his side and don’t believe he would’ve harmed Kathleen.</p><p>A lot of people who have been watching The Staircase on both HBO Max and Netflix have formed their own opinions about whether or not they think Michael murdered Kathleen. Ultimately, he was found guilty in 2003 and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>Eventually, Michael was able to have his sentence overturned. In 2017, he pled to involuntary manslaughter, which reduced his sentence down to 86 weeks.
